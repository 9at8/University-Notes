<p>Algorithm Design and Data Abstraction.</p>
<pre><code>Instructor: Dave Tompkins
Section 003</code></pre>
<p>The <a href="https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs136/">Course Website</a> is expected to be checked by each student at least once a day. ;wip: set up the reminder later</p>
<h1 id="tutorial">6/1/14 - Tutorial</h1>
<p>This course covers Racket for the first part, and then C and abstract concepts for the rest.</p>
<h1 id="section">7/1/14</h1>
<p>The clicker ID for the room is CB, but the prof just said he'll use AA.</p>
<p>Assignments usually due every week Wednesday at noon.</p>
<p>;wip: look around the website, and get a copy of the course notes next week, the electronic one</p>
<p>If you don't want to use the clickers, enter your student number as the clicker ID and you can pass assignment 0.</p>
<p>Every clicker question is out of 2, best 75% of responses counted, every tutorial attend increases final grade 0.1%, but is part of clamped 5% participation grade.</p>
<p>Assignments are to be submitted to <a href="http://marmoset.student.cs.uwateroo.ca/">Marmoset</a>. MarkUs is used too for viewing comments, but students submit to Marmoset. There is less hand marking in this course and more automated testing.</p>
<p>Assignments must be done individually. Do not share or discuss code, not even the strategies.</p>
<p>We are using C with Clang/LLVM (in the RunC environment) and Racket (full Racket, not the teaching languages). Mostly C, though.</p>
<p>RunC works with C and Racket, helps testing, and offers improved error messages.</p>
<p>Lab hours are Tuesdays at 10am to 6pm in MC3003. They give help setting up the environment if needed.</p>
<h2 id="design-recipes">Design Recipes</h2>
<p>Design recipes help design new functions from scratch, and aid communication by providing documentation.</p>
<p>Because we are now apparently familiar with designing functions, we focus on documentation.</p>
<p>The new design recipe for this course is now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purpose</li>
<li>Contract</li>
</ul>
<p>You are also expected to test your code yourself, though they are not required.</p>
<h2 id="main-topics">Main topics</h2>
<ul>
<li>Data structures, abstract data types</li>
<li>Modularization</li>
<li>Imperative programming</li>
<li>Memory management &amp; state</li>
<li>Algorithm design/efficiency</li>
<li>Designing medium size, real world programs with I/O</li>
</ul>
<p>The most common programming paradigms are functional, imperative, object oriented.</p>
<p>Programming involves a lot of <strong>design choices</strong> and <strong>tradeoffs</strong>. Each decision has to be made based on the situation and the requirements.</p>
<p>An abstract data type is a data type with certain properties, but we don't really care how it works. An example would be a dictionary/mapping - we only care about lookup, insert, and remove, not whether it uses association lists or binnary trees or anything.</p>
<h1 id="section-1">9/1/14</h1>
<p>Racket, by default outputs the resulting values of the top level expressions to the interactions window.</p>
<p>But in the real world, we often want to do explicit input and output - keyboard, mouse, screen, speakers.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; &quot;hello, world&quot;
&quot;hello, world&quot;
&gt; (printf &quot;hello, world&quot;)
hello, world</code></pre>
<p>In this course we are required to use <code>printf</code> rather than top-level expressions.</p>
<p>There is also the related function <code>format</code> that accepts values in the same form as <code>printf</code>, but rather than printing out the formatted value to standard output, produces the value as a string.</p>
<p>In CS135 the programs written were not interactive - the sessions in the interactions window were not part of the programs.</p>
<p><code>printf</code> does not insert the newline at the end of the line:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; (printf &quot;a&quot;) (printf &quot;a&quot;)
aa
&gt; (printf &quot;a\n&quot;) (printf &quot;a&quot;)
a
a</code></pre>
<p><code>\\n</code> here means a newline. To make a literal backslash, use two backslashes: <code>\\\\</code>.</p>
<p>What if we need to print a number? The first parameter of <code>printf</code> must be a string. We can use a <strong>placeholder</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; (printf &quot;the number is ~a, though the others are ~a and ~a, plus ~a.\n&quot; 4 &#39;test123 &quot;bla&quot; &#39;(1 2 3))
the number is 4, though the others are test123 and bla, plus (1 2 3).</code></pre>
<p><code>printf</code> is available only in full racket. To print out a literal tilde (<code>~</code>), use two tildes (<code>~~</code>).</p>
<p>In racket, we can do input by using <code>(read)</code>. This allows the user to enter a single line. The resulting value is what <code>(read)</code> evaluates to:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; (printf &quot;hello, ~a&quot; (read))
% Anthony
hello, Anthony</code></pre>
<h2 id="functional-vs.-imperative-vs.-object-oriented">Functional vs. Imperative vs. Object Oriented</h2>
<p>A programming paradigm is an approach or philosophy to programming.</p>
<p>The <strong>functional programming paradigm</strong> (CS135) is to only use new values that stay constant. It is a mathematical way of computing. We produce new values rather than changing old ones. Racket is a multi-paradigm language, but is primarily used as a functional langauge.</p>
<p>The <strong>imperative programming paradigm</strong> (CS136) is to be able to modify state. We compute things based on changing values that we already have. In imperative programs, we give a sequence of statements that tell the computer what to do. C is a multi-paradigm language, but is primarily used as an imperative langauge.</p>
<p>The <strong>object oriented programming paradigm</strong> (CS246) is to have objects that we can send messages to and receive responses from.</p>
<p>This course focuses on imperative programming.</p>
<h2 id="statemodularization">State/Modularization</h2>
<p>State is the value of some data/information at a moment in time. It is related to memory.</p>
<p>In Racket, the state is the definitions made. But the states that were already defined at any moment in time were never changed. In contrast, C allows the already existing states to be changed.</p>
<p>Actually, we can still change state in Racket, thanks to the special form <code>(set! CONSTANT VALUE)</code> (&quot;set-bang&quot;).</p>
<pre><code>&gt; (define n 5)
&gt; n
5
&gt; (set! n &quot;six&quot;)
&gt; n
&quot;six&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The constant behaves as if it was defined as it was set that way in the first place:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; (define n 5)
&gt; (define (f) (add1 n))
&gt; (f)
6
&gt; (set! n 1)
&gt; (f)
2</code></pre>
<p>The <code>!</code> suffix in the function name means that it changes state, and we should be careful when using it.</p>
<p>When we change state, we mutate it. Manipulation of state is mutation. In imperative programming languages, programmers may not use the term &quot;mutation&quot;, but use the term &quot;immutable&quot; rather than &quot;constants&quot;.</p>
<p>Now we will call constants in Racket &quot;variables&quot;, since we can use <code>set!</code>. When the difference matters, we use &quot;constants&quot; for things that don't change, and &quot;mutable variables&quot; for things that can.</p>
<p>Section 2 is covered in Monday's tutorial.</p>
<h2 id="modularization">Modularization</h2>
<p>In larger projects, we need to break our code into pieces to make it easier to work on. Modularization is the practice of doing so in such a way as to group related functionality together into <strong>modules</strong>.</p>
<p>A good real-world example of modularization is a battery - a self-contained package that provides electrical power. It has all three qualities of a good module:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reusability: a good module can be reused in multiple places, so we can use it again and again without writing another one.</li>
<li>Maintainability: a single module is easier to debug, write, and improve - we only need to change the specific module we are looking for, and can even replace the module entirely without affecting everything else.</li>
<li>Abstraction: we don't need to care about how it is written, just how we can use it. We can hide all the complex stuff in a module and make the resulting interface simple to use.</li>
</ul>
<p>Modularization is also called <strong>separation of concerns</strong>.</p>
<p>A program that allows students to order school supplies online might have the following modules:</p>
<ul>
<li>One for looking up course requirements.</li>
<li>One for keeping track of inventory.</li>
<li>One for creating a virtual shopping cart.</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider a tax processing module. The tax code is rather complex, so:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reusability: We can reuse the tax module in lots of other projects.</li>
<li>Maintainability: When tax codes change, we just change that one module.</li>
<li>Abstraction: We don't need to care about the details of the tax code, and leave it up to the module.</li>
</ul>
<p>Modules are available in Racket too:</p>
<pre><code>;; frobnicate.rkt

(provide fun?) ; make `fun?` visible in the program scope

;; frobnicates?: Int -&gt; Bool
;; Determines whether `k` frobnicates the discombobulator
(define (frobnicates? k) (= k 2))

;; some_program.rkt

(require &quot;fun.rkt&quot;)

&gt; (fun? 2)
#t</code></pre>
<p><code>provide</code> and <code>require</code> are special forms that make variables visible externally from other programs and import them other programs, respectively.</p>
<p>In other words, <code>provide</code> exports the specified variables from the module, and <code>require</code> imports the exports from a module.</p>
<p>All Racket files are already modules, but by default they have nothing provided, so the requiring program can't access anything in them.</p>
<p>Now we have three levels of scope (for this course):</p>
<ul>
<li>Local scope: only visible inside the block or <code>local</code> region.</li>
<li>Module scope (formerly global scope): only visible inside the module/file.</li>
<li>Program scope: only visible to the current program (provided value).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="interfaces">Interfaces</h3>
<p>Note that require will basically run the program too, so if there are any top-level values, they will get printed out.</p>
<p>Modules <strong>should not make unnecessary output</strong>. This might confuse the automated marking systems and cause assignment tests to fail:</p>
<pre><code>;; this is a module
&quot;test&quot; ; unnecessary output</code></pre>
<p>In modules, make sure to only put definitions, and not values.</p>
<p>The <strong>module interface</strong> is the list of functions the module provides, including the contract and purpose (documentation). It is everything a client would need to use the module.</p>
<p>The <strong>module implementation</strong> is the definitions of the functions in the module - the code itself.</p>
<p>The interface of a battery is the cylindrical container with two terminals. The implementation is nickel metal-hydride or something else.</p>
<p>A module interface should have some basic elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overall description of the module - what it is designed to do</li>
<li>A list of the functions provided</li>
<li>A contract and purpose for every function</li>
<li>Usage examples.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this course function contracts have been extended from those in CS135 with preconditions and postconditions:</p>
<pre><code>;; sum-first: Int -&gt; Int
;;     PRE: k &gt;= 1
;;     POST: produce an Int &gt;= 1
;; (sum-first k) produces the sum of the integers 1..k
(define (sum-first k)
    ...)</code></pre>
<p>Note that preconditions and postconditions are part of the contract, not their own element. The preconditions are the conditions that must be true before calling the function, and the postconditions are the conditions that will be true after the function is called - a specification of what the function produces.</p>
<p>More complex preconditions and postconditions should be written as English sentences describing what the data should look like.</p>
<p>This allows the contract to convey more information about what is allowed: following the preconditions and obeying the contract while calling the function results in the postconditions being met. These conditions are both logical statements.</p>
<p>A function that takes no parameters has a contract that starts off something like <code>FUNCTION_NAME: -&gt; RETURN_VALUE</code>, or alternatively, <code>FUNCTION_NAME: Void -&gt; RETURN_VALUE</code>.</p>
<p>A precondition that is always met no matter what can be written as <code>PRE: #t</code>. Likewise with postconditions.</p>
<p>In Racket, there are even built in facilities in the language that help enforce the preconditions and postconditions. However, we will not be using them - the conditions in our programs will be informal.</p>
<h1 id="tutorial-1">13/1/14 - Tutorial</h1>
<p>Review of differences between teaching languages use in CS135 and the full version of Racket:</p>
<ul>
<li>DrRacket should be set to &quot;Determine language from source&quot; and Racket source fiiles should start with <code>#lang racket</code>. This is often omitted in the course notes.</li>
<li>Functions can be defined that do not accept any parameters: <code>(define (x) 27)</code>, <code>(x)</code> =&gt; <code>27</code>.</li>
<li>Racket programs are sequences of definitions and top-level expressions (expressions that are not inside of a definition). When a program is run, it is evaluated top to bottom, binding each definition to its value and evaluating each top-level expression.</li>
<li><code>#t</code> and <code>#f</code> are the boolean literals, and <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> are constants defined to <code>#t</code> and <code>#f</code>, respectively. All <strong>non-false values are treated as true</strong>.
<ul>
<li><code>(and a b ... y z)</code> returns <code>#f</code> if all arguments false, <code>#t</code> if no arguments, otherwise the last argument.</li>
<li><code>(or a b ... y z)</code> returns the first non-false argument if there is one, and <code>#f</code> otherwise.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>cond</code> does not produce an error if all the questions in the question/answer pairs are false, instead producing <code>#&lt;void&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>We are allowed to use <code>(if condition evaluate-if-true evaluate-if-false)</code>, which is equivalent to <code>(cond [condition evaluate-if-true] [else evaluate-if-false])</code>.</li>
<li>Structures can now be defined with <code>struct</code> in addition to <code>define-struct</code>, and constructors are named the same as the struct without the <code>make-</code> prefix. FOr example, <code>make-posn</code> is now <code>posn</code>.
<ul>
<li>To make testing easier, we should use <code>#:transparent</code> in the structure definitions, which allows us to see what's inside the structure when printing them out: <code>(struct posn (x y) #:transparent)</code>.</li>
<li>By default, structures are <strong>opaque</strong>, which means when when we display them using something like <code>printf</code>, we can see inside the fields.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We should be familiar with <code>cons</code>, <code>list</code>, <code>empty</code>, <code>first</code>, <code>rest</code>, <code>list-ref</code>, <code>length</code>, <code>append</code>, and <code>reverse</code>. Later on, also <code>last</code> and <code>drop-right</code>.
<ul>
<li><code>(list-ref list n)</code> returns the <code>n</code>-th element of <code>list</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Racket allows one to cons a value to <strong>any other value</strong>, even a non-list value.</li>
<li>Racket does not have <code>member?</code>, but <code>(member value list)</code> returns <code>#f</code> if <code>value</code> is not in <code>list</code>, otherwise the list starting at the first occurrence of <code>value</code> in <code>list</code>: <code>(member 3 '(1 2 3 4))</code> =&gt; <code>'(3 4)</code>.</li>
<li>Functions are still first-class values, and we are expected to be familiar with <code>filter</code>, <code>map</code>, <code>foldr</code>, <code>foldl</code>, and <code>build-list</code>.</li>
<li><code>check-expect</code> is no longer available - we can use <code>equal?</code> for now.</li>
</ul>
<p>The scope of an identifier is the region in the code where it is available for use - the locations where it is visible. <code>local</code> creates a new scope where local definitions are bound to the scope of the <code>local</code>'s extents.</p>
<p>Scopes of top-level definitions are <strong>global</strong>, and scopes of function parameters and local definitions are <strong>local</strong>.</p>
<p>The scope of a definition usually starts where it is defined, and ends at the end of the block where it resides in, excluding any nested local scopes where it is shadowed by a local definition in the nested scope:</p>
<pre><code>; c is not available here
(define c 3)
; c is available here
(local [(define c 4)]
    c) ; this is a different c, and the original c is not available here
; c is available here</code></pre>
<p>Definitions made inside a function body are implicitly local:</p>
<pre><code>(define (f x)
    (define c 10) ; this is a local definition
    (add1 c))</code></pre>
<p>The above is equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code>(define (f x)
    (local [(define c 10)] ; this is a local definition
        (add1 c)))</code></pre>
<p>There is an <strong>implicit local</strong> in the body of every function, so all definitions inside a function body are assumed to be local to the function.</p>
<h1 id="section-2">14/1/14</h1>
<p>Racket modules should have their interfaces at the top of the file.</p>
<p>In the implementation, we do not need to rewrite the documentation for the stuff that is provided.</p>
<p>Functions that are not provided should have their contract and purposes included with them.</p>
<p>The top of the file should be visible only to the client, while the rest is for the developer only.</p>
<p>Example module (<code>sum.rkt</code>):</p>
<pre><code>;; A module for summing numbers [description of module] ; description should appear on the first line

(provide sum-first sum-squares) ;; [list of functions]

;; sum-first: Int -&gt; Int
;;     PRE: k &gt;= 1
;;     POST: produce an Int &gt;= 1
;; (sum-first k) produces the sum of the integers 1..k

;; sum-squares: ...

;;;;;;;;;; IMPLEMENTATION ;;;;;;;;;;

;; see interface above [no further info required] ; functions that are provided should not have their documentation rewritten
(define (sum-first n) ...)

;; private-helper: Int -&gt; Int
;; [contract &amp; purpose for private helper function]
(define (private-helper p) ...)</code></pre>
<p>Locally defined functions should also have their contracts and purposes.</p>
<p>We cannot redefine stuff with the same identifier. To simulate this, we can use local scopes.</p>
<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<p>Racket has no <code>check-expect</code>, and we are to avoid using top-level expressions. How do we do testing?</p>
<p>A good solution is to use testing modules. For example, for the <code>sum.rkt</code> module, we might write <code>test-sum.rkt</code>:</p>
<pre><code>;; this is a simple testing module for sum.rkt

(require &quot;sum.rkt&quot;)

; Each of the following should produce #t

(equal? (sum-first 1) 1)
(equal? (sum-first 2) 3)
(equal? (sum-first 3) 6)
(equal? (sum-first 10) 55)
(equal? (sum-first 99) 4950)</code></pre>
<p>To test private functions, it might be useful to provide testing functions, like <code>test-sum</code> for the <code>sum</code> module.</p>
<h2 id="interface-design">Interface Design</h2>
<p>The goals of interface module design are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>High Cohesion</strong>: everything in the module works towards a common goal - they are related to each other and generally work together.
<ul>
<li>For example, a university course should focus on a single subject, and not jump around from ancient history to mathematics. This is low cohesion - the</li>
<li>Cohesion makes it easier to understand individual modules.</li>
<li>The thermostat should not control the garage door.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Low Coupling</strong>: modules do not interact between each other - module A should not depend on module B if module B depends on module A.
<ul>
<li>Dependency loops mean that the module can't be separated from any of the others in the loop, which makes them highly coupled and poorly designed.</li>
<li>An example of high coupling might be a university course with a lot of prerequisites, co-requisites, and etc. The courses in this example are highly coupled.</li>
<li>Coupling makes testing and understanding the code more difficult.</li>
<li>The car should start even if the radio doesn't work.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Information Hiding</strong>: the interface should be designed to hide the details of the implementation.
<ul>
<li>This is for purposes of <strong>flexibility</strong> allowing us to change the implementation without affecting the client</li>
<li>We also do this for <strong>security</strong> - protecting secret information or preventing tampering or protecting the client from themselves.</li>
<li>The only way a client should be able to interact with the module should be <strong>through the interface</strong>.</li>
<li>A battery's interface should not rely on it using nickel metal-hydride - we should be able to change the chemistry of the battery without affecting it interface.</li>
<li>A user account manager should not expose usernames and passwords to the client. We should also be able to swap out the data structure it uses (like from lists to structs) without the client noticing.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>;wip: it seems like the Boolean in CS135 is changed to Bool</p>
<h3 id="abstract-data-types">Abstract Data Types</h3>
<p>On a related topic, an <strong>abstract data type</strong> (ADT) is simply a module, that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is meant for data storage.</li>
<li>The client can only access through the interface functions (called &quot;ADT operations&quot;).</li>
<li>The data structure and implementation of the ADT is hidden from the client.</li>
</ul>
<p>A <strong>collection ADT</strong> is one that can store an arbitrary number of items, and is generalized to be able to store many different types of items.</p>
<p>An example of this is a dictionary, which maps keys to values.</p>
<p>In some contexts, referring to an &quot;ADT&quot; is the same thing as referring to a &quot;collection ADT&quot; in this context - there are no such things as non-collection ADTs in these contexts.</p>
<p>Not all modules store data, and not all data storage modules are ADTs.</p>
<h3 id="balance">Balance</h3>
<p>Security and flexibility is good. But so is transparency - exposing various details of the implementation to empower the client to do more with the module.</p>
<p>Interface design involves a lot of tradeoffs between things like the amount of information hiding used in order to make the best possible interface for a given set of requirements.</p>
<h2 id="functional-c">Functional C</h2>
<p>We now move to C programming. We will only be using the features that also exist in Racket for now to make the transition easier.</p>
<p>C was designed to be a portable systems programming language that is easy to translate into machine code.</p>
<p>It is designed to give low-level access to computer memory, while still being easy to port to other machines.</p>
<p>We use the C99 standard in this course, finalized in 1999.</p>
<p>Just as Racket can be used in an imperative way, C can be programmed in a functional way, using the functional programmming paradigm.</p>
<p>Comments in Racket:</p>
<pre><code>; single line comment
#|
multi-line

|#</code></pre>
<p>Comments in C:</p>
<pre><code>// single line comment

/*
multi-line
comment
*/</code></pre>
<p>Racket constant: <code>(define n 42)</code> C constant: <code>const int n = 42;</code></p>
<p><code>const</code> indicates the variable is <strong>immutable</strong>, and <code>int</code> indicates that the variable is an <strong>integer</strong>. The <code>= 42</code> is the <strong>initializer</strong>. The whole thing together is a <strong>definition</strong>.</p>
<p>All definitions in C end with a semicolon.</p>
<p>Identifiers must sart with a letter or underscore, and can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores.</p>
<p>We will use <code>underscore_case</code> for our variable names.</p>
<p>Racket uses <strong>dynamic typing</strong> - the type of an identifier is determined while the program is running, which allows us to <strong>change its type at runtime</strong>. C uses <strong>static typing</strong> - the type of an identifier is determined before the program runs, which means that the type of an identifier <strong>cannot be changed while the program is running</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, in C, we cannot define an integer constant, and later set it to a string. However, this is entirely possible in Racket.</p>
<p>Because types cannot be changed and are always explicit in the code, we no longer need to check the input types like we did in Racket (<code>integer?</code>, <code>false?</code>, etc.).</p>
<p>In C, all constants (immutable variables) <strong>must be initialized</strong>. All mutable variables <strong>should be initialized</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="operators">Operators</h3>
<p>C uses infix notation for expressions, similar to math, and expression operators all have their own precedences (conceptually similar to order of operations in math):</p>
<pre><code>const int k = 3 + 4 * 2; // `k` is now 11
const int l = (3 + 4) * 2; // `l` is now 14</code></pre>
<p>Note that parentheses now serve only to group things together, and otherwise have no syntactic significance.</p>
<p>If an expression is ambiguous or confusing, use parentheses to make it clearer.</p>

<p>In C, operators such as addition and division are distinct from functions in syntax and functionality. The order of operations is similar to those in math.</p>
<p>Operators are distinct language constructs with their own rules for syntax. They are described in detail in the textbook. Operators may have different associtivities and precedences.</p>
<p>C has almost 50 operators in total, many of which work on data.</p>
<p>The <code>a / b</code> operator in C over integers divides two numbers, always rounding towards 0. It behaves similar to <code>quotient</code> in Racket.</p>
<p>The <code>a % b</code> operator in C behaves the same as the <code>remainder</code> function in Racket. With negative numbers, C can give confusing results - <strong>avoid using negative numbers</strong> for this reason.</p>
<p>In Racket, we <strong>apply</strong> a function, which <strong>consumes</strong> arguments and <strong>produces</strong> a value.</p>
<p>In C, we <strong>call</strong> a function, which is <strong>passed</strong> arguments and <strong>returns</strong> a value.</p>
<h3 id="functions">Functions</h3>
<p>Racket:</p>
<pre><code>;; my-sqr: Int -&gt; Nat
;;     PRE: #t
;;     POST: produce square of `x`
;; (my-sqr x) produces the square of `x`
(define (my-sqr x)
    (* x x))</code></pre>
<p>C:</p>
<pre><code>// my_sqr(x) squares `x`
//     PRE:  true
//     POST: return value &gt;= 0
int my_sqr(int x) {
    return x * x;
}</code></pre>
<p>The curly braces indicate the function <strong>block</strong>, the body of the function.</p>
<p>The type of every value must be specified explicitly. The <code>return</code> statement is mandatory for functions that have non-void return types.</p>
<p>As a result, errors like <code>(my-sqr &quot;a&quot;)</code> in Racket give a runtime error, while in C, this is caught by the compiler - contract violations cannot exist.</p>
<p>We call functions in a way similar to defining them:</p>
<pre><code>// my_add(x, y) adds `x` and `y`
//     PRE:  true
//     POST: true
int my_add(x, y) {
    return x + y;
}

// my_num() returns 42
//     PRE:  true
//     POST: return value == 42
int my_num(void) { // `void` here means there are no parameters
    return my_add(40, 2);
}</code></pre>
<p>In C, our function documentation starts with the purpose and doesn't need the contract (due to static typing). The preconditions and postconditions are still necessary.</p>
<h3 id="entry-point">Entry Point</h3>
<p>The <strong>entry point</strong> is the place where we start running the program.</p>
<p>In Racket, the entry point of the program is the top of the file being run.</p>
<p>In C, the entry point of the program is the body of the <code>main</code> function. Every C program must have a <code>main</code> function.</p>
<p><code>main</code> has no parameters (for now) and an <code>int</code> return type to indicate if the program was successful (zero) or not (non-zero).</p>
<pre><code>// no documentation is required!
int main(void) {
    // program starts here
    // this is the only typed function where we can omit the return value and it will assume 0 (success)
}</code></pre>
<p>Modules don't need a <code>main</code> function, because they are not meant to have entry points.</p>
<p>The <code>void</code> means that the function does not accept any parameters, and is different from just not using anything (<code>int main()</code>).</p>
<h3 id="library">Library</h3>
<p>C has no built-in functions. However, it has a lot of modules that are almost always available.</p>
<p>First C program:</p>
<pre><code>// first C program

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void) {
    printf(&quot;Hello, World!\n&quot;);
}</code></pre>
<p>In C, <code>printf</code> uses different placeholders for each type, and the placeholder specifier (<code>~</code> in Racket) is <code>%</code>. A literal percent sign is <code>%%</code>. As with Racket, the number of extra arguments needs to match the number of placeholders:</p>
<pre><code>printf(&quot;I am 100%% sure that %d + %d = %d&quot;, 2, 2, 5);</code></pre>
<p><code>printf</code> is found in a lot of computer languages, and it has mmuch more functionaity than is covered here. For example:</p>
<pre><code>printf(&quot;%04d&quot;, 42); // prints 0042, length 4 with &quot;0&quot; padding</code></pre>
<h3 id="top-level">Top-level</h3>
<p>In C, top-level expressions are invalid, except for ones resulting in constant values:</p>
<pre><code>// top level

const int a = 3 * 3 // valid
const int b = my_sqr(4) // invalid
3 * 3; //invalid
my_sqr(4); //invalid</code></pre>
<p>We can still use expressions inside definitions inside of functions: <code>int main(void) { const int a = my_sqr(4); }</code>.</p>
<h3 id="booleans">Booleans</h3>
<p>In C, False is represented by 0, and any non-zero value is considered True.</p>
<p>Equality testing in C is done using <code>a == b</code>, resulting in 1 or 0. The <code>a = b</code> is for <strong>assignment only</strong> and is one of the most common C errors.</p>
<p>Non-equality testing in C is done using <code>a != b</code>, resulting in 1 or 0. Negation is done using <code>!a</code>.</p>
<p>Logical AND is done using <code>a &amp;&amp; b</code>, and logical OR is done using <code>a || b</code>, both returning 1 or 0. Like in Racket, they short-circuit with the same rules. Remember to use <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>||</code> rather than <code>&amp;</code> and <code>|</code>, which are bitwise operators and do different things.</p>
<p>The <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;=</code> operators are self-explanatory.</p>
<p>Note that <code>&gt;</code> has a higher precedence than <code>==</code>, so <code>1 == 3 &gt; 0</code> is <code>1 == (3 &gt; 0)</code>, which could be confusing. Always use parentheses when there is the possibility of confusion.</p>
<p>The <code>a ? b : c</code> is known as the <strong>ternary operator</strong> (<strong>conditional operator</strong>). It works like <code>(if a b c)</code> in Racket. If <code>a</code> is true, it evaluates and returns <code>b</code>, otherwise <code>c</code>. It short-circuits, so one of <code>b</code> or <code>c</code> is not evaluated: <code>x &gt;= 0 ? x : -x</code> results in the absolute value.</p>
<p>Like in Racket, we must define a function before we can call it. However, C needs to know the type signature of the function before being able to compile it.</p>
<p>As a result, in C, a function must be declared before it is called at all. When compiling, the compiler scans the code from top to bottom, and whenever compiling a function, needs to know the type signature before proceeding.</p>

<p>Dictionary interface:</p>
<pre><code>(struct dict (alist))

;; dict-new: -&gt; Dict
(define (dict-new)
    (dict empty))

;; dict-lookup: Dict Int -&gt; Any
(define (dict-lookup d k)
    (define (al-search al)
        (cond [(empty? al) #f]
              [(= k (first (first al))) (second (first al))]

;; dict-size: Dict -&gt; Nat
(define (dict-size d)

<p>Consider the following Racket function:</p>
<pre><code>;; gcd: Nat Nat -&gt; Nat
;;     PRE: #t
;;     POST: produce the GCD of `a` and `b`
;; (gcd a b) calculates the GCD of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm
(define (gcd a b)
    (if (= b 0) a (gcd b (remainder a b))))</code></pre>
<p>We can translate this into C:</p>
<pre><code>// gcd(a, b) finds the GCD of `a` and `b`
//     PRE: #t
//     POST: produce the GCD of `a` and `b`
int gcd(int a, int b) {
    return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b)
}</code></pre>
<h1 id="section-4">21/1/14</h1>
<p>What about mutual recursion in C? A function must always be defined before it is called, yet this is impossible in mutual recursion:</p>
<pre><code>int a(int x) {
    b(x - 1)
}

int b(int x) {
    a(x - 1)
}</code></pre>
<p>There is no possible ordering of functions that allows this to be valid.</p>
<h3 id="declarations">Declarations</h3>
<p>Here, we must use a <strong>forward declaration</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>int b(int x); // note that we can also omit the name, like `int b(int)`, but this is not recommended

int a(int x) {
    b(x - 1)
}

int b(int x) {
    a(x - 1)
}</code></pre>
<p>This is a function <strong>declaration</strong> (something that specifies the type of an identifier). It gives the types of the parameters and return values.</p>
<p>The header is present, but the body code block is omitted.</p>
<p>The actual functions with code blocks are <strong>definitions</strong> (something that specifies the information necessary to create the identifier). All definitions must include a declaration.</p>
<p>We can also declare variables before defining them, using the <code>extern</code> keyword: <code>extern const int x;</code>. Declarations cannot be initialized.</p>
<p>Identifiers can be declared as many times as needed, but can only be defined once. Declaring something is the same thing as saying that it will be defined at some point.</p>
<p>We can use this to implement modules:</p>
<pre><code>// sum.c
// define p &amp; sum
const int p = 2;
int sum(int k) {
    return (k &lt;= 1) ? 1 : k + sum(k-1);
}

// client.c
// declare p &amp; sum
extern const int p;
int sum(int k);
int double _ sum(int n) {
    return p * sum(n);
}</code></pre>
<p>Note that we did not actually define the functions in the client code. They are simply declared to exist somewhere, and then we add them in at the linking stage.</p>
<h3 id="scope">Scope</h3>
<pre><code>const int a = 5; // GLOBAL/PROGRAM SCOPE - at the top level of the program
static const int s = 17; // MODULE SCOPE - `static` keyword makes declaration in the module scope

int f(int b) { // GLOBAL/PROGRAM SCOPE - at top level of the program
    // `b` is a 
    
    const int c = 3; // LOCAL SCOPE - inside a block
    
    {
        const int d = 11; // LOCAL SCOPE - inside a local scope inside the function
    }
    
    // `d` is no longer available here
}

static int g(int e) { // MODULE SCOPE - `static` keyword makes declaration in the module scope
    return e;
}

// `b` and `c` are no longer available here</code></pre>
<p>Note that a block created using <code>{ ... }</code> creates a new local scope inside. This works similarly to Racket's <code>local</code>.</p>
<p>Note that <code>static</code> can be used to make a variable or function visible only in</p>
<p>By default, all functions and variables exist in the program scope, and other modules (C source files) can access them.</p>
<p>The scope rules in C are roughly the same as those in Racket - the innermost binding occurence shadows all the outer ones.</p>
<h3 id="interfaces-1">Interfaces</h3>
<p>Modules, as stated earlier, have an interface and an implementation. In C, we can put the interface in one file, and the implementation in another.</p>
<p>The interface goes in a <strong>header file</strong> (<code>x.h</code>) and the implementation in a <strong>source file</strong> (<code>x.c</code>). They should have the same name for RunC to know that they are related.</p>
<p>The source file should always <code>#include</code> the header file, because the header file might define constants or structures or similar that we want to use in the implementation, and because it allows us to catch differences between the interface and implementation.</p>
<p>The <code>#include</code> statement is a <strong>preprocessor directive</strong>. The preprocessor is the first stage of compilation, an informal part of the C standard, and works on the source code as text. Preprocessor directives must appear on the first column of a line, without any preceding whitespace.</p>
<p>The preprocessor does not know anything about C and works purely on text. In fact, it can be used with other programming languages. Preprocessor directives are special instructions that modify the source code text in some way.</p>
<p>For example, <code>#define X Y</code> performs a string replacement, replacing all instances of <code>X</code> with <code>Y</code>.</p>
<p>When we <code>#include</code> a file, we basically paste its contents into the current file at that location.</p>
<p>Now in client code, when we need a module, we just need to <code>#include</code> its header file to include its interface. Note that when we include the header file, we no longer need to have the forward declarations at the top of the client code. This is, in practice, similar to what Racket's <code>require</code> does, but they are conceptually very different - here, we are copy/pasting the interface rather than running a file.</p>
<p>The interface documentation for a function that isn't provided to clients (helper functions) should not go in the header file. Instead, they go directly above the function definition.</p>
<p>If asked to write a module, but only allowed to submit a C source file (<code>*.c</code>), put the interface documentation right above its definition.</p>
<p>Otherwise, for modules, above the definition of the function, put a comment to the effect of <code>;; see header file</code>.</p>
<p>If asked to write a C program, put the interface documentation right above its definition. Note that the <code>main</code> function does not require any interface documentation.</p>
<h3 id="library-1">Library</h3>
<p>C has basically no useful built-in functionality - a lot of functionality is provided through the library. The standard modules can be included by using <code>#include &lt;NAME&gt;</code>, where <code>NAME</code> is the filename of the module header. Some examples would be <code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</code> (standard I/O) and <code>#include &lt;math.h&gt;</code> (math functions).</p>
<p>The <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> simply changes the place the preprocessor searches to find the specified file.</p>
<p>The <code>stdbool.h</code> header provides the Boolean type <code>bool</code> and the constants <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> (for example, <code>const bool x = true;</code>). These are still just the integers 0 and 1, but look cleaner and are more clear.</p>
<p>If we need to use Boolean types in the interface, then we can simply put the <code>#include &lt;stdbool.h&gt;</code> into the header file.</p>
<p>C has no symbols, but we can simulate them by defining constants with unique integer values, and using those constants as we would use symbols.</p>
<h3 id="testing-1">Testing</h3>
<p>The <code>assert.h</code> module provides assertion functionality, similar to <code>check-expect</code> in Racket. For example:</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;assert.h&gt;

int main(void) {
    assert(1 == 1);
    return 0;
}</code></pre>
<p>The module provides a function <code>assert(x)</code> which terminates the program if given a false value, and does nothing otherwise.</p>
<p>The advantage of using this module is that we can compile our programs in debug and release modes. In debug mode, the program will catch any assertion errors and report them for easy fixing. In release mode, the function can be made to do nothing at all, which improves performance.</p>
<p>We do testing with a separate testing module. This module does not really need a header, and only really needs a main function and to include the <code>assert</code> library and the module we need to test. In the <code>main</code> function, we have our assertions:</p>
<pre><code>// test-thing.c: testing module for thing.h
#include &lt;assert.h&gt;
#include &quot;thing.h&quot;
int main(void) {
    assert(do_something(2) == 5);
    assert(do_it(3) == 1);
}</code></pre>
<p>Whenever possible, we should assert the preconditions of our functions. For example, if a function accepts only positive values for its parameter <code>a</code>, then it should have <code>assert(a &gt; 0);</code> near the beginning.</p>
<h3 id="structures">Structures</h3>
<pre><code>struct posn {
    int x;
    int y;
};</code></pre>
<p>This is a structure declaration. Unlike Racket, it does not define any functions to help operate on these structures. The semicolon at the end is required.</p>
<p>We can define a new instance of this structure by using it as a type: <code>const struct posn p = {2, 3};</code>. Note that the type is <code>struct posn</code>, as one atomic unit.</p>
<p>The initializer can also be written as <code>{.y = 3, .x = 2}</code>. Using this syntax it is not necessary to remember the order of the fields.</p>
<p>The initializer syntax is valid only in these forms. The curly braces cannot be used in expressions or other places.</p>
<p>All fields that are not initialized are automatically set to 0.</p>
<p>We can access elements of this structure using the <code>.</code> operator: <code>p.x</code> and <code>p.y</code> access one of each field in the structure.</p>
<p>We cannot compare structures using <code>==</code>, or print them out with <code>printf</code>. Structures must be compared or printed field-by-field, and it may be useful to write helper functions to do this.</p>
<p>Structure declarations are in the module scope by default, which makes them opaque to client code, but if we put it in the interface file, they are transparent.</p>
<h1 id="section-5">23/1/14</h1>
<h2 id="c-memory-model">C Memory Model</h2>
<p>The most common number systems in use today are binary, decimal, and hexadecimal.</p>
<p>Hexadecimal has the special property of each digit representing 4 digits of binary, simply by replacing the digit with the binary digits. This is because <span class="math">\(2^4 = 16\)</span> and there are 16 digits.</p>
<p>In C, hex numbers are written as <code>0x1234</code>. Without the <code>0x</code> prefix, the number is assumed to be decimal.</p>
<p>Computers use bits internally, which are grouped into groups of 8 called bytes. Because they have 8 digits, they have 256 possible states.</p>
<p>The size of a kilobyte can be 1000 or 1024 bytes, depending on the context. In scientific literature, the kilobyte (KB) is 1000 bytes, and a kibibyte (KiB) is 1024. Likewise with megabytes, gigabytes, etc. These two can differ up to 7% for gibibytes vs. gigabytes.</p>
<p>Most computer archtectures have primary memory (RAM) and secondary memory (HDD, SSD, flash drives, optical disks, etc.). When we say memory, we usually refer to primary memory.</p>
<p>Primary memory is very fast, smaller, higher cost, and volatile. Contrast this with secondary storage is slower, larger, cheaper, and persistent.</p>
<p>Programs can only really run in primary memory - programs need to be copied into primary memory before executing. In this course, we will only need to think in terms of primary memory.</p>
<p>The smallist unit of memory we can access is a byte. The location of the byte in memory is the <strong>address</strong> of the byte. For example, with 1 MB of memory, the address of the first byte is 0 and the last is <span class="math">\(2^20 - 1\)</span>. We usually represent addresses in hex.</p>
<p>In this course, we will now need to be aware of the memory our program is using. In CS135 we had stepping rules. Now we introduce the C memory model.</p>
<p>When C gets to a variable definition, it reserves the storage for that variable, keeps track of the address of that storage location to refer to it later, and stores the initial value of the variable in that location. Then, when we reference a variable, we retrieve or set it from the address we determined earlier. Note that variable declarations <strong>do not do this</strong>.</p>
<p>In the CS135 model, variables are basically aliases for values. Now, we consider them as names for locations where a value is stored. When a variable appears in an expression, C obtains the contents of that location.</p>
<p>We can determine how much memory a variable uses by using the <code>sizeof(X)</code> operator. This looks like a function but is actually an operator. Usually <code>sizeof(int)</code> is 4. <code>sizeof</code> also works on variables and literals. We can assume integers are 4 bytes in this course.</p>
<p>If we define an int, C finds 4 consecutive bytes of memory to store it, and then keeps track of the first address. Then, it updates those 4 bytes to the initial value.</p>
<p>Note that because integers only has 4 bytes, we can only represent the integers from <span class="math">\(-2^{31}\)</span> to <span class="math">\(2^{31} - 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>If we <code>#include &lt;limits.h&gt;</code>, <code>INT_MIN</code> and <code>INT_MAX</code> are defined to these limiting values.</p>
<p>If we use <code>unsigned int</code>, we can represent integers from 0 to <span class="math">\(2^{32} - 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>We should always try to work within these limits. If we work outside of these ranges, an <strong>overflow</strong> occurs. For example, if we add 1 to <span class="math">\(2^{31} - 1\)</span>, we wrap around to <span class="math">\(-2^{31}\)</span>, like in mmodular arithmetic.</p>
<p>In C, we can also have variables that use only 1 byte. The <code>char</code> type can store any integer from -128 to 127. They are not very useful for calculations, but we often use them to store characters, like ASCII character codes.</p>
<p>In ASCII, upper case chars start with &quot;A&quot; at 65, lower case starts with &quot;a&quot; at 97, and a space is 32. 0 to 31 are the control sequences. For example, 7 is a bell and 10 is a linefeed (newline or <code>\\n</code>).</p>
<p>On Windows, the end of line character is a line feed and a carriage return. On Linux the end of line character is just a line feed. This can cause confusion when working on files made on different operating systems.</p>
<p>Char types are internally just numbers:</p>
<pre><code>const char a = &#39;a&#39;; // single quotes mean char types
const char other_a = 97; // this is the same thing as the above

printf(&quot;%d %c&quot;, a, a); // %d prints the integer value, while %c prints the ASCII character - this prints &quot;97 a&quot;</code></pre>
<p>It is important to note that single quotes (<code>'x'</code>) denote characters and double quotes (<code>&quot;x&quot;</code>) denote strings.</p>
<pre><code>char to_lowercase(char c) {
    return (c &gt;= &#39;A&#39; &amp;&amp; c &lt;= &#39;Z&#39;) ? c - &#39;A&#39; + &#39;a&#39; : c;
}</code></pre>
<h1 id="tutorial-3">27/1/14 - Tutorial</h1>
<p>Didn't attend this one, but it was about translating Racket into C - pretty trivial stuff.</p>
<h1 id="section-6">28/1/14</h1>
<p>Note that a structure declaration does not reserve any memory. Memory is reserved only when a structure type variable is defined.</p>
<p>The <code>sizeof</code> a structure is at least the sum of the <code>sizeof</code> every field. However, it may be more due to padding or alignment - extra space used to improve efficiency. The exact size of a structure is not deterministic and can depend on a lot of things.</p>
<p>Floating point numbers in C are <strong>inexact numbers</strong>. They have a certain amount of precision and all operations on these nunmbers do not necessarily preserve all of the precision. They work a lot like inexact numbers in Racket.</p>
<p>Floating point values can lose precision in a lot of operations. Adding, subtracting, and a lot of others. It is similar to using significant digits, and then cutting off everything after a certain number of significant digits.</p>
<p>Floating point numbers can result in bugs and precision errors, and are a common source of issues.</p>
<p>For example, the square root of 2 actually results in a number that is close to, but not exactly, the square root of 2.</p>
<p>Floating point numbers are called floating point because they have a number of bits (24 on our 32-bit architecture) called the mantissa, and an 8-bit exponent, which represents the position of the decimal place. This decimal place is <strong>floating</strong>, which gives us the name.</p>
<p>We can also use a <code>double</code> type, which is usually larger than a float, and therefore has a larger mantissa. Therefore, it can represent numbers with more precision.</p>
<p>The placeholder for a <code>float</code> in <code>printf</code> format strings is <code>%f</code>. For example, <code>printf(&quot;%f&quot;, 1.05)</code>.</p>
<p>Integers are always exact, and we should always try to use integers when possible. For example, to represent money, instead of using a float for the number of dollars, we can use an integer for the number of cents.</p>
<h3 id="sections">Sections</h3>
<p>We model our memory with 5 regions known as <strong>sections</strong>, ordered from lower addresses to higher addresses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code
<ul>
<li>The machine code goes here.</li>
<li>When we write code, we write human-readable code. Then, the compiler converts it into machine code that the computer can read. This is addressed in CS 241.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Read-only Data
<ul>
<li>Global constant variables go here.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Global Data
<ul>
<li>Global mutable variables go here.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Heap
<ul>
<li>This is addressed in a later section ;wip</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Stack
<ul>
<li>Local variables go here.</li>
<li>This contains the call stack.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Computer hardware groups these sections into <strong>segments</strong>. If we try to access memory outside of the segment we're currently in without explicitly allowing it, then we get a <strong>segmentation fault</strong> or <strong>segfault</strong>.</p>
<p>There is also another section, <strong>temporary storage</strong>, that stores the intermediate results of expressions.</p>
<p>All global variables are initialized before <code>main</code> is called. First the memory for global variables is reserved and initialized, then the <code>main</code> function is called. This is done at the compilation stage.</p>
<p>The sections can have different sizes depending on the program, but each program has a fixed size for each section.</p>
<p>As a result, once <code>main</code> is called, no more global variables can be defined.</p>
<p>Running Programs:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>For each module:
<ul>
<li>Scan for <code>#include</code>s, and add entries to the internal module list.</li>
<li>Preprocessing.</li>
<li>Scan for errors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Verify all the functions and variables are defined and only defined once.</li>
<li>Create read-only and global data sections for global variables.</li>
<li>Convert the program to machine code.</li>
<li>Perform RunC testing (more in section 7).</li>
<li>Run <code>main</code>.</li>

<p>In Racket, our semantic model is based on substitution rules - we replaced something with other things based on patterns that we looked for. In C, we use <strong>control flow</strong> to model our programs.</p>
<h3 id="call-stack">Call Stack</h3>
<p>While running our program, we keep track of the program location, which is where we currently are in the code.</p>
<p>However, when we call a function, we need to keep track of the new program location (the function we called) and the place we want to go back to when we use <code>return</code> (right after the place we called the function). The place we want to go back to is called the <strong>return address</strong>.</p>
<p>If <span class="math">\(f\)</span> calls <span class="math">\(g\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(g\)</span> calls <span class="math">\(h\)</span>, we need to keep track of where we were in <span class="math">\(f\)</span> when we called <span class="math">\(g\)</span>, and where we were in <span class="math">\(g\)</span> when we called <span class="math">\(h\)</span>, and where we currently are in <span class="math">\(h\)</span>.</p>
<p>In this course, we represent return addresses with <code>CALLING__FUNCTION:LINE_NUMBER</code>, except for <code>main</code>. The return address for the <code>main</code> function is <code>OS</code>, for the operating system.</p>
<p>We can store these chunks of context information in a stack. This stack we call the <strong>call stack</strong>. Every time we call a function is called, we push an entry onto the stack. Every time a function returns, we pop an entry off the top of the stack and go back to the return address specified in the entry.</p>
<p>The entries stored on the stack are known as <strong>stack frames</strong>, or <strong>frames of reference</strong>. Every stack frame contains the return address, all currently existing local variables, and all arguments to the function. Note that the return value goes into the temporary storage section.</p>
<p>Local variables includes variables in block scopes:</p>
<pre><code>int f(void) {
    const int a = 5; // this is one local variable
    {
        const int a = 6; // this is another local variable
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>A function must be called with simple values, like with our Racket stepping rules. Calling a function makes a copy of all these simple values and puts it into the new stack frame. This is called a <strong>call-by-reference</strong> calling convention.</p>
<p>Recall that global variables have their memory reserved before the program starts. In contrast, local variables have their memory reserved on the stack, inside a stack frame. They are created when the containing function is called.</p>
<p>Because local variables are created automatically when a function is called, they are sometimes called <strong>automatic variables</strong>.</p>
<p>In hardware, the program location is called the <strong>program counter</strong>. It is the address of the machine code instruction that is currently excuting.</p>
<p>Programming has a duality between what we want to do, and what it is actually doing. Programming is the task of makking these two match up, either by changing what you want, or sitting down and writing code.</p>
<p>Using this new control flow model, self-recursion is simply jumping over to the beginning of the function, but with a new stack frame. The only unusual part is that the return address is inside the same function.</p>
<p>The call stack can be found in the stack section of the memory model seen earlier. Note that it starts at the highest available address with the stack frame for <code>main</code>, and new stack frames are created at lower addresses - the stack grows downwards.</p>
<p>If the stack gets too big, it will grow all the way into the heap section. This might cause a segmentation fault, or worse, corrupt data and cause undefined behaviour. This is called a <strong>stack overflow</strong>, and is usually caused by infinite or very deep recursion.</p>
<h1 id="section-7">30/1/14</h1>
<h2 id="pointers-woo">POINTERS WOO</h2>
<p>The address of an identifier is the <strong>location in memory where its first byte occurs</strong>. We can obtain this address using the <code>&amp;</code> operator:</p>
<pre><code>const int f = 2
int g = 1;
int main(void) {
    const int h = 6;
    printf(&quot;CODE: %p, READ-ONLY: %p, GLOBAL DATA: %p, STACK: %p&quot;, &amp;main, &amp;f, &amp;g, &amp;h);
}</code></pre>
<p>The pointer placeholder is &quot;%p&quot; in C.</p>
<p>This allows us to get low-level access to the memory and work with pointers - addresses in memory.</p>
<p>A <strong>pointer</strong> is a type in C that represents an address in memory:</p>
<pre><code>const int i = 42;
const int *p = &amp;i; // `p` points to `i`
const int *q = p; // `q` now points to the same thing that `p` does - to `i`
printf(&quot;%p %p %p&quot;, &amp;i, p, q); // these are all the same thing</code></pre>
<p>The asterisk <code>*</code> is part of the type, and denotes a pointer type.</p>
<p>Every type like <code>char</code> or <code>int</code> has a corresponding pointer type <code>char *</code> or <code>int *</code>. This are pointer types, like &quot;char pointer&quot; (pointer to an int).</p>
<p>The size of a pointer is the same as the number of bits that the computer has - a 32-bit computer will use 32-bit addresses. The <code>sizeof</code> a pointer is always the same size regardless of the size of the data that it points to. In this course we assume that each pointer is 4 bytes (32 bits).</p>
<p>The <strong>value</strong> of the pointer is the address that it points to. We represent this as <code>p</code>, with no asterisk or any other operator. This results in a memory address.</p>
<p>The <strong>indirection/dereference operator</strong> is also the asterisk, but should not be confused with the asterisk in the variable declaration. They are two different things.</p>
<p>Pointers also have addresses. We can obtain their address just like any other type of variable, using <code>&amp;p</code>.</p>
<p>Now there are three different ways to look a pointer:</p>
<pre><code>// `p` is a pointer
p // address of the pointer
*p // the value being pointed to by the pointer
&amp;p // an address that points to the pointer</code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>*&amp;i</code> is the same thing as <code>i</code>. We are dereferencing the address of <code>i</code>, which simply results in <code>i</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>*</code> in a declaration belongs to the identifier. This becomes apparent when we use multiple declarations on one line: <code>const int *a = &amp;i, *b = &amp;i;</code>.</p>
<p>We can also make pointers to pointers, and pointers to pointers to pointers, or any level of pointing:</p>
<pre><code>const int i = 42;
const int *pi = &amp;i;
const int **ppi = &amp;pi;
const int ***pppi = &amp;ppi;</code></pre>
<p>The null pointer is essentially a pointer to the address 0, which is reserved and means &quot;nothing&quot; or &quot;invalid&quot;.</p>
<p>We use the null pointer to represent &quot;nothing&quot;. This is generally used to indicate an error or a lack of a value.</p>
<p>In code, we represent null with <code>NULL</code>, and is defined in the <code>stdlib</code> module (as well as several others). To use it, we must first make it available using something like <code>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Usually, we will want to assert that a pointer is not null in functions that accept pointers, and state that null pointers are not accepted in preconditions. We can do this by using <code>assert(p)</code>, since null is essentially 0.</p>
<h2 id="imperative-c">Imperative C</h2>
<p>In our model of C, <strong>state</strong> is a combination of the <strong>location in the code</strong>, and the <strong>contents of the memory</strong> at the moment.</p>
<p>If we have these two pieces of information, we can track what the program will do at any moment in the future. However, this can be difficult because the state can change quite often.</p>
<p>The imperative paradigm is based on the manipulation of state. Functional programming has no side effects, while imperative does.</p>
<p>A <strong>side effect</strong> is when an expression does something more than just producing a value. Side effects change the world - the state or something external to the program. For example, <code>printf</code> does not produce any value at all, and is used only for its side effect.</p>
<p>Racket supports some imperative features:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>(set! var value)</code> can mutate a variable.</li>
<li><code>(begin a b ... y z)</code> evaluates each expression <code>a</code> to <code>z</code> and discards all resulting values except <code>z</code>, which it produces. This is only useful when the expressions have side effects.</li>
<li><code>(printf str ...)</code> can print text to the screen.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>begin</code> is not used very often because each function definition in Racket implicitly uses <code>begin</code>, just like they implicitly use <code>local</code>.</p>
<p>We list the side effects of a function in the postconditions. However, the implementation details should not be exposed in doing so.</p>
<p>In Racket, a function that returns nothing (like <code>printf</code>) actually produces <code>#&lt;void&gt;</code>. In contracts, this is represented with <code>Void</code>.</p>
<p>In C, <code>printf</code> actually produces the number of characters printed. This is useful for checking for printing errors, or getting the string length.</p>
<p>A function in C can simply not return a value, or not accept any parameters:</p>
<pre><code>void f(void) { // this function neither accepts or returns any values
    printf(&quot;Look ma, no arguments!&quot;);
    return; // this is optional for void functions
}</code></pre>
<p>Before, we saw that <code>printf(&quot;Look ma, no arguments!&quot;)</code> is an <strong>expression</strong>. When an expression is the only thing inside a statement, the statement becomes an <strong>expression statement</strong>: <code>printf(&quot;Look ma, no arguments!&quot;);</code> (note the semicolon, which denotes that the code represents a complete statement).</p>
<p>Other expression statements are <code>3 + 2;</code> or <code>a * 7</code>.</p>
<p>The values of expression statements are simply ignored, like those in Racket's <code>begin</code>. Therefore, they are really only useful for their side effects.</p>
<p>In C, a statement is a construct such that it gets executed, but the result is ignored. Statements cannot be used inside expressions, but expressions can be used inside statements.</p>
<h1 id="tutorial-4">3/2/14 - Tutorial</h1>
<p>Another example of floats being horrible:</p>
<pre><code>const float big = 1000000000.0;
const float small = 100.0;
const float diff = big - small;
// diff is now 999999872.0</code></pre>
<p>When we compare floats, we usually want ones that are avery close to each other to be considered equal. We can compare them using an epsilon (error):</p>
<pre><code>const float a = 10.0/3.0;
const float b = 3.333333;

assert(a == b); // failure

const float epsilon = 0.000001;
assert((a - b &lt; 0 ? b - a : a - b) &lt; epsilon); // make sure we compare the absolute value of the difference

// alternatively, we can make two assertions:
assert(-epsilon &lt; a - b);
assert(a - b &lt; epsilon);

// or combine them into one
assert(-epsilon &lt; a - b &amp;&amp; a - b &lt; epsilon);</code></pre>
<p>Consider a function to check if an overflow will occur when adding two integers:</p>
<h1 id="include">include <limits.h></h1>
<h1 id="include-safe_overflow.h">include &quot;safe_overflow.h&quot;</h1>
<pre><code>bool safe_add(int a, int b) {
    int abs_a = a &lt; 0 ? -a : a;
    int abs_b = b &lt; 0 ? -b : a;
    return ((abs_a == a &amp;&amp; abs_b == b) || (abs_a != a &amp;&amp; abs_b != b)) ? // check if signs are the same (only case in which overflow can occur)
        abs_a &lt;= INT_MAX - abs_b : true;
}</code></pre>
<p>Lockstep is when multiple arguments in structural recursion approach the base case at the same rate.</p>
<h1 id="section-8">4/2/14</h1>
<p>Terminology summary:</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; // preprocessor directive
int add1(int x); // function declaration
int add1(int x) { // function definition
    // and block statement
    const int y = x + 1; // local definition
    printf(&quot;add1 called\n&quot;); // expression statement (side effect)
    2 + 2 == 5; // expression statement (no side effect)
    return y; // control flow statement
}</code></pre>
<p>The substitution rule for <code>begin</code> is that each argument is evaluated, and then the simplified value of the last argument is produced.</p>
<p>The three different types of statements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expression Statements</li>
<li>Block Statements</li>
<li>Control Flow Statements</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="compound-statements">Compound Statements</h3>
<p>In C, the block <code>{ CODE_GOES_HERE }</code> creates a compound statement - it groups a bunch of statements together and makes it appear like one statement. Bocks can also have local definitions, which are not statements.</p>
<p>The block is similar to Racket's <code>begin</code>. However rather than producing the last value, it produces no value at all, because it is a statement.</p>
<p>Some functions have only side effects, and don't produce a value. These have the <code>void</code> return type.</p>
<p>Some functions have no side effects, and only produce a value.</p>
<p>It is not useful to have a function that has neither side effects or a return value.</p>
<p>In expressions, we can also use a comma operator (<code>,</code>) to evaluate multiple expressions but produce only the last one. For example, <span class="math">\(a == 1 ? (a = 2, 5 + 6) : 7 + 8\)</span>. This is very similar in functionality to <code>begin</code> in Racket.</p>
<h3 id="control-flow-statements">Control Flow Statements</h3>
<p>Control flow statements are those that change the control flow - they can change the program location and call stack.</p>
<p>Function calls also modify control flow. They change the program location to the target and push a stack frame to the call stack.</p>
<p>An example of this is <code>return</code>, which pops an entry off the top of the call stack and moves the program location to the return address in the popped off stack frame.</p>
<p>Another control flow statement is <code>if</code>:</p>
<pre><code>if (CONDITION) STATEMENT</code></pre>
<p>This executes <code>STATEMENT</code> if and only if <code>CONDITION</code> is truthy. <code>STATEMENT</code> is known as the <strong>body</strong> of the <code>if</code> statement, while <code>CONDITION</code> is the <strong>condition</strong>.</p>
<p>Note that <code>STATEMENT</code> can be a compound statement to execute multiple statements in the body of the <code>if</code>. Note that the parentheses around the condition are required.</p>
<p>We should always put braces around the body of the <code>if</code>, even if there is only one statement. This is a matter of style and improves readability:</p>
<pre><code>if (n &lt; 0) {
    printf(&quot;Hello\n&quot;);
}</code></pre>
<p>Since <code>if</code> doesn't produce a value, it is only really useful to do control flow or side effects in the body of an <code>if</code> statement.</p>
<p><code>if</code> also supports an optional <code>else</code> clause that specifies another statement that gets executed if <code>CONDITION</code> fails:</p>
<pre><code>if (x &lt; 10) {
    // ...
} else {
    // ...
}</code></pre>
<p>The <code>else</code> always belongs to the most recently entered <code>if</code>: <code>if (a) if (b) x; else y;</code> will only do <code>y</code> when <code>a</code> is true and <code>b</code> is false. This is called a <strong>dangling else</strong>.</p>
<p>Note that we can also use another <code>if</code> statement as the body of the <code>else</code> clause:</p>
<pre><code>if (x &lt; 10) {
    // ...
} else if (x &lt; 20) {
    // ...
} else if (x &lt; 30) {
    // ...
} else {
    // ...
}</code></pre>
<p>We can now have a use for multiple return statements in one function:</p>
<pre><code>if (k &lt; 0) {
    return k
} else {
    return -k;
}</code></pre>
<p>Note that since the <code>return</code> statement will stop the rest of the function from executing, the above code is the same as the following:</p>
<pre><code>if (k &lt; 0) {
    return k
}
return -k;</code></pre>
<h2 id="mutation">Mutation</h2>
<p>When we declared variables earlier, we used <code>const TYPE IDENTIFIER ...</code>. Declared without the <code>const</code> keyword, variables are <strong>mutable</strong> - the value of these variables can be changed as often as needed.</p>
<p>Even though we may now use mutation, it is still good practise to use <code>const</code> whenever possible. This is because <code>const</code> communicates to readers and the compiler that the variable is not to be modified, which helps prevent accidental mutation and improves performance.</p>
<p>Mutable variables can be declared without initializing them: <code>int k;</code>. This is generally considered bad style, however.</p>
<p>Global variables, if not initialized, are automatically initialized to 0. Local variables can be initialized to any value, though usually it will be some entries left over from old stack frames.</p>
<h1 id="section-9">6/2/14</h1>
<p>The substitution stepping model stops working with imperative features like <code>set!</code>. ;wip</p>
<h2 id="assignment">Assignment</h2>
<p>In C, we mutate with the <strong>assignment operator</strong> (<code>=</code>). It takes the form of <code>IDENTIFIER = EXPRESSION</code>, where <code>IDENTIFIER</code> is a variable or stricture field:</p>
<pre><code>int m = 5; // this is NOT an assignment, it is part of the initialization syntax
// here, m is 5
m = 28;
// here, m is 28
m = 3;
// here, m is 3</code></pre>
<p>Note that the <code>=</code> in the first line is part of the initialization syntax, not an assignment. They often behave the same, but the difference becomes clear with things like syntax for structures, strings, and arrays:</p>
<pre><code>// we can also use structure fields
struct posn n = {1, 2};
n.x = 4; // this is how we set structure fields
n = {1, 2}; // THIS IS NOT VALID (ONLY IN INITIALIZATION SYNTAX)</code></pre>
<p>The assignment operator takes the <strong>value</strong> on the right side of the <code>=</code> and puts it in the <strong>address</strong> specified on the left side.</p>
<p>So in <code>x = x + 1</code>, <code>x</code> is treated as a value on the right side, and as a address on the left side.</p>
<p>As a result, the left hand side must be addressable - like variables, structure fields, and array elements. These values are called <strong>lvalues</strong>. So <code>x = x + 1</code> is valid, but <code>x + 1 = x</code> is not.</p>
<p>The assignment operator <strong>changes state</strong> because it directly modifies memory (unless we use an identity like <code>x = x;</code>).</p>
<p>The assignment operator is an operator like any other, so it actually produces the right hand side as a value. This is idiomatic for things like <code>a = b = c = 0</code>, which sets all 3 variables to 0. We can then do things like <code>z = 1 + (z = z + 1)</code>, but this is considered very bad style.</p>
<p>This is the cause of a lot of bugs. If we accidentally use <code>=</code> instead of <code>==</code>, we can create some very subtle bugs:</p>
<pre><code>if (x = 1)
    printf(&quot;A&quot;);
else
    printf(&quot;B&quot;);</code></pre>
<p>This code actually assigns 1 to <code>x</code>, and then produces 1, which causes the code to always print &quot;A&quot;.</p>
<p>To mitigate this, we can write equalities like <code>1 == x</code>. This way, if we write <code>=</code> by accident, the resulting code will result in an error, <code>1 = x</code>, since there isn't a valid lvalue on the left.</p>
<p>In C, operations like <code>x = x + y</code> or <code>x = x * y</code> are so common that there are special operators that do it in a shorter way:</p>
<pre><code>x += y // equivalent to `x = x + y`
x -= y // equivalent to `x = x - y`
x *= y // equivalent to `x = x * y`
x /= y // equivalent to `x = x / y`
x %= y // equivalent to `x = x % y`
++ x // equivalent to `x = x + 1`
-- x // equivalent to `x = x - 1`
x ++ // equivalent to `x_old = x, x = x + 1, x_old`
x -- // ALMOST equivalent to `x_old = x, x = x - 1, x_old`</code></pre>
<p>The postfix <code>x ++</code> form is different from <code>++ x</code> in that it produces the original value of <code>x</code>, <strong>before</strong> incrementing the value. In contrast, <code>++ x</code> increment it, and then produces the new incremented value. So the produced value differs by 1.</p>
<h3 id="pointers">Pointers</h3>
<pre><code>int i = 5;
int j = 6;

int *p = &amp;i;
int *q = &amp;j;

p = q; // pointer assignment</code></pre>
<p>After the last line, <code>p</code> now points to the same place <code>q</code>. It changes the <strong>value</strong> of <code>p</code> to the <strong>value</strong> of <code>q</code>, so <code>p</code> then points at <code>j</code>.</p>
<p>Now suppose we instead do the following:</p>
<pre><code>int i = 5;
int j = 6;

int *p = &amp;i;
int *q = &amp;j;

*p = *q; // pointed value assignment</code></pre>
<p>When <code>*p</code> appears on the left side of the assignment, it behaves like we actually wrote the thing it was pointing at, which is <code>i</code>. When <code>*q</code> appears on the right side of the assignment, it resolves to the value of <code>q</code>, which is <code>j</code>.</p>
<p>So after the last line, the value of what <code>p</code> points to is changed to the value <code>q</code> points to. In other words, it changes <code>i</code> to 6, even though <code>i</code> doesn't appear in the assignment.</p>
<p><strong>Aliasing</strong> is when the same memory location can be accessed from more than one variable. Pointers allow aliasing in C.</p>
<p>Note that arguments to functions are <strong>copies</strong> of the original values we passed to the function. Therefore, when we change arguments in functions, the original value is unchanged:</p>
<pre><code>void f(int i) {
    ++ i; // this is a useless function since it has no persistent side effects and produces no values
}

int main(void) {
    int j = 5;
    f(j);
    // `j` is still 5 even though it changed in `f`
}</code></pre>
<p>This is a consequence of using the <strong>pass-by-value</strong> convention, since a copy of the variable in made in the new stack frame.</p>
<p>Another convention is <strong>pass-by-reference</strong>, where a variable passed to a function can be changed by that function. Some languages support both.</p>
<p>In C, we can sort of simulate this using pointers. If we pass the address of the variable we want to allow the function to change to the function, we can have the argument be a pointer to the variable. This allows us to change the variable using pointer value assignment:</p>
<pre><code>void f(int *p) {
    // now `p` is a pointer pointing to `j`
    ++ *p; // this increments the value of the thing being pointed to by `p`
}

int main(void) {
    int j = 5;
    f(&amp;j);
    // now `j` is 6
}</code></pre>
<p>This is still pass-by-value because we passed the address as a value. By passing the addres of <code>j</code>, we can change the value of <code>j</code>. This is also referred to as &quot;passing a pointer to <code>j</code>&quot;.</p>
<p>One thing to be aware of is that <code>*p ++</code> is the same as <code>*(p ++)</code>, due to the order of operations. To make it work properly, we can use parentheses, like <code>(*p) ++</code>. When in doubt, always use parentheses to make the code clearer.</p>
<p>We can use this to produce multiple values from a function, or work with multiple values at once:</p>
<pre><code>int swap(int *x, int *y) {
    int temp = *x;
    *x = *y;
    *y = temp;
}</code></pre>
<p>Note that the following will not work:</p>
<pre><code>int swap(int *x, int *y) {
    int temp = x;
    *x = *y;
    y = temp;
}</code></pre>
<p>This is because afterwards, both <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> will both point to the value of <code>x</code>, so they will not swap the values.</p>
<p>For example, a division function might produce the quotient and remainder with by-reference parameters. This would free up the return value to allow us to give information such as error codes or statistics:</p>
<pre><code>int divide(int n, int d, int *q, int *r) {
    if (d == 0) return 1;
    *q = n / d;
    *r = n % d;
    return 0;
}</code></pre>
<p>We can return 1 on invalid input to let the client know something went wrong.</p>
<p>The return type of a function can also be a pointer. However, we <strong>must not return pointers to addresses in the current stack frame</strong>. Whenever we return from a function, the data in the stack frame should be considered invalid and off-limits. In other words, we should not return pointers to local variables or parameters.</p>
<p>If a function has implementation-specific side effects, such as modifying internal variables, we do not want to show this information in the interface. Instead, we can put these specific details with the implementation of the function.</p>
<h1 id="tutorial-5">10/2/14 - Tutorial</h1>
<pre><code>// collatz(n) returns the length of the Collatz sequence of `n` that ends with 1
//     PRE; n &gt;= 1

int collatz(int n); {
    assert(n &gt;= 1);

    else if (n % 2 == 0)
        return 1 + collatz(n / 2);
    return 1 + collatz(3 * n + 1);
}</code></pre>
<p><code>cond</code> also implicitly uses <code>begin</code> for the answers:</p>
<pre><code>(cond [#t (display &quot;hello&quot;) &#39;return-value])</code></pre>
<p>The above will display the string but produce <code>return-value</code>.</p>
<p>Postconditions in the design recipe now need to focus on the side effects of mutation and are explained in natural language. They should not include too many implementation-specific details.</p>
<p>Note that the following two lines are equivalent:</p>
<pre><code>(*x).y
x-&gt;y</code></pre>
<p>The <code>-&gt;</code> operator is a special operator that accesses the structure field of a structure given by a pointer.</p>
<h1 id="section-10">11/2/14</h1>
<p>When we use the <code>static</code> keyword on local variables, we can make it behave like a global variable that is only accessible inside of the function - we make a <strong>persistent local variable</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>int f(void) {
    static int counter = 0; // this is initialized at the start of the program
    return counter ++;
}</code></pre>
<p>Just like global variables, they are stored in the global data section in memory. As a result, the global data section is also known as the &quot;global/static data&quot; section.</p>
<p><code>int *p = NULL</code> is equivalent to <code>int *p; p = NULL;</code>, not <code>int *p; *p = NULL;</code>.</p>
<p>When we call a function, all of the arguments are copied into the local stack frame. When we pass larger structures to function by value, this can get very inefficient - we have to copy the entire structure into the new stack frame. In addition to reducing performance, this causes our stack frames to get much larger and may even contribute to a stack overflow.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can oass pointers to structures instead to reduce overhead:</p>
<pre><code>int sqr _ dist(struct posn *p1, struct posn *p2) {
    const int xdist = p1-&gt;x - p2-&gt;x;
    const int ydist = p1-&gt;y - p2-&gt;y;
    return xdist * xdist + ydist * ydist;
}</code></pre>
<p>Note the use of the second structure selection operator, <code>-&gt;</code>, which works on pointers to structures rather than the structures itself.</p>
<p>If a function accepts a pointer parameter, it should clearly state whether the parameter gets mutated in the documentation.</p>
<p>We can also use the <code>const</code> keyword to denote that the parameter isn't to be changed:</p>
<pre><code>void immutable_posn(const struct posn *p) {
    p-&gt;x = 5; // this cannot be changed because the parameter is constant - the compiler will catch this
}</code></pre>
<p>It is good style to use <code>const</code> for pointer parameters whenever possible.</p>
<pre><code>int *p; // pointer and pointed value mutable
const int *p // pointer mutable, pointed value immutable
int * const p = &amp;i; // pointer immutable, pointed value mutable
const int * const p = &amp;i; // pointer and pointed value immutable</code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>const int i</code> is the same as <code>int const</code>. <code>const</code> always applies to the type on the left, onlless there are no types on the left, in which case it applies to the type on the right.</p>
<h2 id="iteration">Iteration</h2>
<p>Looping combines mutation with control flow. Looping allows us to do things multiple times.</p>
<p>Instead of recursion, we now have iteration. The interesting thing about iterating is that it will never result in a stack overflow.</p>
<h3 id="while-loop">While loop</h3>
<p>The while control flow statement takes the form of <code>while (CONDITION) BODY;</code>. It works as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Evaluate <code>CONDITION</code>. If false, we are done with the loop and move on.</li>
<li>Evaluate <code>BODY</code>.</li>
<li>Go back to step 1.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, printing numbers from 1 to 100:</p>
<pre><code>int i = 1;
while (i &lt;= 100) {
    printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, i);
    i --;
}</code></pre>
<p>It is easy to accidentally make an infinite loop. Common forms include:</p>
<pre><code>while (i &lt; 100) f(); i --; // bad nesting
while (i &lt; 100); f(x); // extra semicolon
while (i = 100) f(x); // assignment rather than equality
while (true) f(x); // best way to make an infinite loop intentionally</code></pre>
<h3 id="do-while-loop">Do-While Loop</h3>
<p>The do-while control flow statement takes the form of <code>do STATEMENT while (CONDITION);</code>. It works almost exactly like the while loop, except the condition is evaluated at the end:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Evaluate <code>BODY</code>.</li>
<li>Evaluate <code>CONDITION</code>. If false, we are done with the loop and move on.</li>
<li>Go back to step 1.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, ensuring success:</p>
<pre><code>int i = 1;
int success; // uninitialized variable
do {
    success = g(); // this is guaranteed to run at least once
    i --;
} while (!success)</code></pre>
<p>This loop is occasionally useful because it guarantees that its body will be run at least once.</p>
<h3 id="for-loop">For Loop</h3>
<p>The for control flow statement takes the form of <code>for (SETUP; CONDITION; UPDATE) BODY;</code>. It is simply a shortcut for writing a very common pattern used in while loops.</p>
<p>This is almost exactly equivalent to <code>{ SETUP; while (CONDITION) { BODY; UPDATE; } }</code>.</p>
<p>The only difference is that when we use <code>continue</code>, the for loop will also execute <code>UPDATE</code> before continuing with the next iteration.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Evaluate <code>SETUP</code>.</li>
<li>Evaluate <code>CONDITION</code>. If false, we are done with the loop and move on.</li>
<li>Evaluate <code>BODY</code>.</li>
<li>Evaluate <code>UPDATE</code>.</li>
<li>Go back to step 2.</li>
</ol>
<p>This allows us to write an extremely common looping pattern into one concise statement. For example, printing numbers from 1 to 100.</p>
<pre><code>for (int i = 1; i &lt;= 100; i ++) printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, i);</code></pre>
<p>Note that in C99, we can use definitions too in our statements, like in <code>SETUP</code>. These definitions are in the scope of the for loop.</p>
<p>We can also omit the statements. If we omit the condition, it is assumed to be true:</p>
<pre><code>for (;;) f(x); // infinite loop
for (; i &lt; 50); // skip setup
for (i = 1, j = 2;;) // statements can use the comma operator to cram in multiple side effects</code></pre>
<h3 id="extra-control-flow">Extra Control Flow</h3>
<p>Inside of loops, additional control flow statements are available that allow us to do some extra things.</p>
<p>The <code>break;</code> statement ends the current innermost loop immediately. and moves to directly after the loop.</p>
<p>The <code>continue;</code> statement skips to the end of the body of the innermost loop and goes to the next iteration of the loop. It means that we want to continue looping, but want to skip the rest of this particular iteration.</p>
<p>These statements are useful, but they can always be avoided by restructuring the code.</p>
<p>Using loops to solve problems is called using an <strong>iterative</strong> approach. Before, we used the <strong>recursive</strong> approach. Both have their own advantages. Iteration is simply an alternative to recursion, used much more often in imperative programming. Sometimes recursion is easier to understand than iteration, and sometimes the other way around. They are different tools that are useful in different places.</p>
<h1 id="section-11">13/2/14</h1>
<h2 id="inputoutput">Input/Output</h2>
<p><strong>I/O</strong> stands for <strong>input/output</strong>. It refers to how programs interact with the real world.</p>
<p>This includes receiving input via a keyboard or mouse, or sending things to a screen or printer, or even to and from a hard drive.</p>
<p>With Racket we had <code>printf</code> with <code>~a</code> (basic placeholder) and <code>~v</code> (placeholder with extra type information). With C we have <code>printf</code> as well, with placeholders <code>%d</code> (decimal integer), <code>%c</code> (character), <code>%f</code> (float), <code>%p</code> (pointer/address).</p>
<p>In C, writing to files is quite similar to writing to the standard output:</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(void) {
    FILE *file_ptr;
    file_ptr = fopen(&quot;hello.txt&quot;, &quot;w&quot;); // w for write
    fprintf(file_ptr, &quot;Hello World!\n&quot;);
    fclose(file_ptr);
}</code></pre>
<p><strong>Tracing</strong> code is the process of adding logging output for the program to aid debugging and diagnostics.</p>
<p>We can use things like trace variables to turn tracing on and off:</p>
<pre><code>const bool DEBUG = true; // set to false to turn off tracing
// ...
if (DEBUG) printf(&quot;The value of i is: %d\n&quot;, i);</code></pre>
<p>In Racket, <code>'&quot;string&quot;</code> is the same thing as <code>&quot;string&quot;</code>, and <code>'14</code> is the same as <code>14</code>. The quotes do not change numbers and strings.</p>
<h3 id="read">Read</h3>
<p>The <code>read</code> function in Racket attempts to read a value from the keyboard. If there are no values, it pauses the entire program until there is. Read can also produce <code>#&lt;eof&gt;</code>, which means that there is no more input (End Of File).</p>
<p>In RunC, we can send EOF using Ctrl-D. EOF is a special character in the operating system that is treated specially by many programs.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; (read)
#&gt; abc
&#39;abc
&gt;&gt;&gt; (read)
#&gt; 14
14
&gt;&gt;&gt; (read)
#&gt; &quot;string&quot;
&quot;string&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; (read)
#&gt; (a
#&gt; b c
#&gt; d)
&#39;(a b c d)</code></pre>
<p>Read has rather complicated behaviour, but for now it is sufficient to think of it as prepending a single quote <code>'</code> to our input and then interpreting it as a Racket literal value.</p>
<p>We can test for <code>read</code> giving EOF by using the type predicate <code>eof-object?</code>, which returns a boolean indicating whether a value is an EOF.</p>
<h3 id="scanfgetchar">Scanf/Getchar</h3>
<p>In C, <code>scanf</code> is the input counterpart to <code>printf</code>. It &quot;scans&quot; the standard input for certain patterns like <code>%d</code> for a decimal integer, simimlar to <code>printf</code>'s placeholders.</p>
<p>It usually takes the form of <code>scanf(&quot;%d&quot;, &amp;i)</code>, where <code>&quot;%d&quot;</code> specifies the things to scan for, and <code>&amp;i</code> specifies the pointer to which the scanned value is stored. <code>scanf</code> produces an <code>int</code>.</p>
<p>In this course, we will only be using one placeholder at a time. <code>scanf</code> places the result at the specified address, and returns an integer representing the status. The return value is the number of items actually read in. So a value of 0 means no values were read in (error or invalid input) and a value of 1 means we successfully read one value.</p>
<p><code>scanf</code> can also return <code>EOF</code> (usually defined as -1) when it encounters an EOF in the input. Basically, we have an error if we get 0, success if we get 1, and end of input if we get EOF.</p>
<p>We could use <code>scanf(&quot;%c&quot;, &amp;x)</code>, but there is also a function <code>getchar()</code> designed specifically for this purpose. <code>getchar</code> accepts no parameters and produces the next character typed by the user on the keyboard as an integer representing the ASCII value of that character, or <code>EOF</code> if an EOF is given to the program.</p>
<p><code>getchar</code> returns an integer because it could return any of the 256 possible characters, plus EOF.</p>
<pre><code>int x = getchar();
int y;
if (scanf(&quot;%d&quot;, &amp;y) == 1)
    printf(&quot;You entered: %d&quot;, y);</code></pre>
<h3 id="testing-2">Testing</h3>
<p>Using these I/O functions, we can now create <strong>interactive testing modules</strong> - modules that let us interactively test some functionality provided by our module:</p>
<pre><code>#include &quot;addsqr.h&quot;
int main(void) {
    char func;
    int x,y;
    do {
        func = getchar();
        if (func == &#39;a&#39;) {
            scanf(&quot;%d&quot;, &amp;x);
            scanf(&quot;%d&quot;, &amp;y);
            printf(&quot;add %d %d = %d\n&quot;, x, y, add(x,y));
        } else if (func == &#39;s&#39;) {
            scanf(&quot;%d&quot;, &amp;x);
            printf(&quot;sqr %d = %d\n&quot;, x, sqr(x));
        }
    } while (func != &#39;x&#39;);
}</code></pre>
<p>This is a very barebones testing module that can get the job done. It doesn't handle invalid inputs or edge cases, since it is only meant to be used by testers.</p>
<p>Now when we run it, we can use it to test various values of our functions:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s 10
sqr 10 = 100
&gt;&gt;&gt; a 1 1
add 1 1 = 2</code></pre>
<p>In fact, RunC has facilities to automate using this sort of interactive testing module.</p>
<p>If the interactive testing module is located in <code>test.c</code>, then RunC will look for <code>test.in.1</code> in the same directory, and then run the program with the contents of that file as the input, as if the user was typing the contents into the terminal directly. The resulting output of the program is stored in <code>test.out.1</code>. This also works for <code>test.in.2</code>, <code>test.out.2</code>, etc.</p>
<p>If there is a <code>test.expect.1</code> file, then RunC will compare the actual output with the output in this file, and if there are any differences, it generates <code>test.check.1</code>, which shows the differences side by side.</p>
<p>This allows us to automate testing in a much more straightforward way, and also allows to test program outputs.</p>
<p>If we are using non-interactive testing (using <code>assert</code>, for example), we can just use an empty <code>test.in.1</code> file and still use a <code>test.expect.1</code> file to test output.</p>
<p>When we are testing code, we often want to check for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Off-by-one errors in loops.</li>
<li>If the initial loop condition is never met.</li>
<li>Every possible execution path in the code should be tested.</li>
<li>Large argument values that could result in overflow, like <code>INT_MAX</code> or <code>INT_MIN</code>.</li>
<li>Special argument values like <code>-1</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>0</code>, <code>NULL</code>, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>When testing a module with side effects (like the shopping cart question in assignment 4), it is sometimes not sufficient to test each function by itself - we have to test sequences of function calls, testing the interaction between functions.</p>
<p><strong>Integration testing</strong> is when we test interactions between modules and groups of modules all at once.</p>
