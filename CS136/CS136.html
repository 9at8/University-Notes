<h1 id="cs136">CS136</h1>
<p>Algorithm Design and Data Abstraction.</p>
<pre><code>Instructor: Dave Tompkins
Section 003</code></pre>
<p>The <a href="https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs136/">Course Website</a> is expected to be checked by each student at least once a day. ;wip: set up the reminder later</p>
<h1 id="tutorial">6/1/14 - Tutorial</h1>
<p>This course covers Racket for the first part, and then C and abstract concepts for the rest.</p>
<h1 id="section">7/1/14</h1>
<p>The clicker ID for the room is CB, but the prof just said he'll use AA.</p>
<p>Assignments usually due every week Wednesday at noon.</p>
<p>;wip: look around the website, and get a copy of the textbook next week, the electronic one</p>
<p>If you don't want to use the clickers, enter your student number as the clicker ID and you can pass assignment 0.</p>
<p>Every clicker question is out of 2, best 75% of responses counted, every tutorial attend increases final grade 0.1%, but is part of clamped 5% participation grade.</p>
<p>Assignments are to be submitted to <a href="http://marmoset.student.cs.uwateroo.ca/">Marmoset</a>. MarkUs is used too for viewing comments, but students submit to Marmoset. There is less hand marking in this course and more automated testing.</p>
<p>Assignments must be done individually. Do not share or discuss code, not even the strategies.</p>
<p>We are using C with Clang/LLVM (in the RunC environment) and Racket (full Racket, not the teaching languages). Mostly C, though.</p>
<p>RunC works with C and Racket, helps testing, and offers improved error messages.</p>
<p>Lab hours are Tuesdays at 10am to 6pm in MC3003. They give help setting up the environment if needed.</p>
<h2 id="design-recipes">Design Recipes</h2>
<p>Design recipes help design new functions from scratch, and aid communication by providing documentation.</p>
<p>Because we are now apparently familiar with designing functions, we focus on documentation.</p>
<p>The new design recipe for this course is now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purpose</li>
<li>Contract</li>
</ul>
<p>You are also expected to test your code yourself, though they are not required.</p>
<h2 id="main-topics">Main topics</h2>
<ul>
<li>Data structures, abstract data types</li>
<li>Modularization</li>
<li>Imperative programming</li>
<li>Memory management &amp; state</li>
<li>Algorithm design/efficiency</li>
<li>Designing medium size, real world programs with I/O</li>
</ul>
<p>The most common programming paradigms are functional, imperative, object oriented.</p>
<p>Programming involves a lot of <strong>design choices</strong> and <strong>tradeoffs</strong>. Each decision has to be made based on the situation and the requirements.</p>
<p>An abstract data type is a data type with certain properties, but we don't really care how it works. An example would be a dictionary/mapping - we only care about lookup, insert, and remove, not whether it uses association lists or binnary trees or anything.</p>
