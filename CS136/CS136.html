<p>Algorithm Design and Data Abstraction.</p>
<pre><code>Instructor: Dave Tompkins
Section 003</code></pre>
<p>The <a href="https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs136/">Course Website</a> is expected to be checked by each student at least once a day. ;wip: set up the reminder later</p>
<h1 id="tutorial">6/1/14 - Tutorial</h1>
<p>This course covers Racket for the first part, and then C and abstract concepts for the rest.</p>
<h1 id="section">7/1/14</h1>
<p>The clicker ID for the room is CB, but the prof just said he'll use AA.</p>
<p>Assignments usually due every week Wednesday at noon.</p>
<p>;wip: look around the website, and get a copy of the course notes next week, the electronic one</p>
<p>If you don't want to use the clickers, enter your student number as the clicker ID and you can pass assignment 0.</p>
<p>Every clicker question is out of 2, best 75% of responses counted, every tutorial attend increases final grade 0.1%, but is part of clamped 5% participation grade.</p>
<p>Assignments are to be submitted to <a href="http://marmoset.student.cs.uwateroo.ca/">Marmoset</a>. MarkUs is used too for viewing comments, but students submit to Marmoset. There is less hand marking in this course and more automated testing.</p>
<p>Assignments must be done individually. Do not share or discuss code, not even the strategies.</p>
<p>We are using C with Clang/LLVM (in the RunC environment) and Racket (full Racket, not the teaching languages). Mostly C, though.</p>
<p>RunC works with C and Racket, helps testing, and offers improved error messages.</p>
<p>Lab hours are Tuesdays at 10am to 6pm in MC3003. They give help setting up the environment if needed.</p>
<h2 id="design-recipes">Design Recipes</h2>
<p>Design recipes help design new functions from scratch, and aid communication by providing documentation.</p>
<p>Because we are now apparently familiar with designing functions, we focus on documentation.</p>
<p>The new design recipe for this course is now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purpose</li>
<li>Contract</li>
</ul>
<p>You are also expected to test your code yourself, though they are not required.</p>
<h2 id="main-topics">Main topics</h2>
<ul>
<li>Data structures, abstract data types</li>
<li>Modularization</li>
<li>Imperative programming</li>
<li>Memory management &amp; state</li>
<li>Algorithm design/efficiency</li>
<li>Designing medium size, real world programs with I/O</li>
</ul>
<p>The most common programming paradigms are functional, imperative, object oriented.</p>
<p>Programming involves a lot of <strong>design choices</strong> and <strong>tradeoffs</strong>. Each decision has to be made based on the situation and the requirements.</p>
<p>An abstract data type is a data type with certain properties, but we don't really care how it works. An example would be a dictionary/mapping - we only care about lookup, insert, and remove, not whether it uses association lists or binnary trees or anything.</p>
<h1 id="section-1">9/1/14</h1>
<p>Racket, by default outputs the resulting values of the top level expressions to the interactions window.</p>
<p>But in the real world, we often want to do explicit input and output - keyboard, mouse, screen, speakers.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; &quot;hello, world&quot;
&quot;hello, world&quot;
&gt; (printf &quot;hello, world&quot;)
hello, world</code></pre>
<p>In this course we are required to use <code>printf</code> rather than top-level expressions.</p>
<p>In CS135 the programs written were not interactive - the sessions in the interactions window were not part of the programs.</p>
<p><code>printf</code> does not insert the newline at the end of the line:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; (printf &quot;a&quot;) (printf &quot;a&quot;)
aa
&gt; (printf &quot;a\n&quot;) (printf &quot;a&quot;)
a
a</code></pre>
<p><code>\\n</code> here means a newline. To make a literal backslash, use two backslashes: <code>\\\\</code>.</p>
<p>What if we need to print a number? The first parameter of <code>printf</code> must be a string. We can use a <strong>placeholder</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; (printf &quot;the number is ~a, though the others are ~a and ~a, plus ~a.\n&quot; 4 &#39;test123 &quot;bla&quot; &#39;(1 2 3))
the number is 4, though the others are test123 and bla, plus (1 2 3).</code></pre>
<p><code>printf</code> is available only in full racket. To print out a literal tilde (<code>~</code>), use two tildes (<code>~~</code>).</p>
<p>In racket, we can do input by using <code>(read)</code>. This allows the user to enter a single line. The resulting value is what <code>(read)</code> evaluates to:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; (printf &quot;hello, ~a&quot; (read))
% Anthony
hello, Anthony</code></pre>
<h2 id="functional-vs.-imperative-vs.-object-oriented">Functional vs. Imperative vs. Object Oriented</h2>
<p>A programming paradigm is an approach or philosophy to programming.</p>
<p>The <strong>functional programming paradigm</strong> (CS135) is to only use new values that stay constant. It is a mathematical way of computing. We produce new values rather than changing old ones. Racket is a multi-paradigm language, but is primarily used as a functional langauge.</p>
<p>The <strong>imperative programming paradigm</strong> (CS136) is to be able to modify state. We compute things based on changing values that we already have. In imperative programs, we give a sequence of statements that tell the computer what to do. C is a multi-paradigm language, but is primarily used as an imperative langauge.</p>
<p>The <strong>object oriented programming paradigm</strong> (CS246) is to have objects that we can send messages to and receive responses from.</p>
<p>This course focuses on imperative programming.</p>
<h2 id="statemodularization">State/Modularization</h2>
<p>State is the value of some data/information at a moment in time. It is related to memory.</p>
<p>In Racket, the state is the definitions made. But the states that were already defined at any moment in time were never changed. In contrast, C allows the already existing states to be changed.</p>
<p>Actually, we can still change state in Racket, thanks to the special form <code>(set! CONSTANT VALUE)</code> (&quot;set-bang&quot;).</p>
<pre><code>&gt; (define n 5)
&gt; n
5
&gt; (set! n &quot;six&quot;)
&gt; n
&quot;six&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The constant behaves as if it was defined as it was set that way in the first place:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; (define n 5)
&gt; (define (f) (add1 n))
&gt; (f)
6
&gt; (set! n 1)
&gt; (f)
2</code></pre>
<p>The <code>!</code> suffix in the function name means that it changes state, and we should be careful when using it.</p>
<p>When we change state, we mutate it. Manipulation of state is mutation. In imperative programming languages, programmers may not use the term &quot;mutation&quot;, but use the term &quot;immutable&quot; rather than &quot;constants&quot;.</p>
<p>Now we will call constants in Racket &quot;variables&quot;, since we can use <code>set!</code>. When the difference matters, we use &quot;constants&quot; for things that don't change, and &quot;mutable variables&quot; for things that can.</p>
<p>Section 2 is covered in Monday's tutorial.</p>
<h2 id="modularization">Modularization</h2>
<p>In larger projects, we need to break our code into pieces to make it easier to work on. Modularization is the practice of doing so in such a way as to group related functionality together into <strong>modules</strong>.</p>
<p>A good real-world example of modularization is a battery - a self-contained package that provides electrical power. It has all three qualities of a good module:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reusability: a good module can be reused in multiple places, so we can use it again and again without writing another one.</li>
<li>Maintainability: a single module is easier to debug, write, and improve - we only need to change the specific module we are looking for, and can even replace the module entirely without affecting everything else.</li>
<li>Abstraction: we don't need to care about how it is written, just how we can use it. We can hide all the complex stuff in a module and make the resulting interface simple to use.</li>
</ul>
<p>Modularization is also called <strong>separation of concerns</strong>.</p>
<p>A program that allows students to order school supplies online might have the following modules:</p>
<ul>
<li>One for looking up course requirements.</li>
<li>One for keeping track of inventory.</li>
<li>One for creating a virtual shopping cart.</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider a tax processing module. The tax code is rather complex, so:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reusability: We can reuse the tax module in lots of other projects.</li>
<li>Maintainability: When tax codes change, we just change that one module.</li>
<li>Abstraction: We don't need to care about the details of the tax code, and leave it up to the module.</li>
</ul>
<p>Modules are available in Racket too:</p>
<pre><code>;; frobnicate.rkt

(provide fun?) ; make `fun?` visible in the program scope

;; frobnicates?: Int -&gt; Bool
;; Determines whether `k` frobnicates the discombobulator
(define (frobnicates? k) (= k 2))

;; some_program.rkt

(require &quot;fun.rkt&quot;)

&gt; (fun? 2)
#t</code></pre>
<p><code>provide</code> and <code>require</code> are special forms that make variables visible externally from other programs and import them other programs, respectively.</p>
<p>In other words, <code>provide</code> exports the specified variables from the module, and <code>require</code> imports the exports from a module.</p>
<p>All Racket files are already modules, but by default they have nothing provided, so the requiring program can't access anything in them.</p>
<p>Now we have three levels of scope (for this course):</p>
<ul>
<li>Local scope: only visible inside the block or <code>local</code> region.</li>
<li>Module scope (formerly global scope): only visible inside the module/file.</li>
<li>Program scope: only visible to the current program (provided value).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="interfaces">Interfaces</h3>
<p>Note that require will basically run the program too, so if there are any top-level values, they will get printed out.</p>
<p>Modules <strong>should not make unnecessary output</strong>. This might confuse the automated marking systems and cause assignment tests to fail:</p>
<pre><code>;; this is a module
&quot;test&quot; ; unnecessary output</code></pre>
<p>In modules, make sure to only put definitions, and not values.</p>
<p>The <strong>module interface</strong> is the list of functions the module provides, including the contract and purpose (documentation). It is everything a client would need to use the module.</p>
<p>The <strong>module implementation</strong> is the definitions of the functions in the module - the code itself.</p>
<p>The interface of a battery is the cylindrical container with two terminals. The implementation is nickel metal-hydride or something else.</p>
<p>A module interface should have some basic elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overall description of the module - what it is designed to do</li>
<li>A list of the functions provided</li>
<li>A contract and purpose for every function</li>
<li>Usage examples.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this course function contracts have been extended from those in CS135 with preconditions and postconditions:</p>
<pre><code>;; sum-first: Int -&gt; Int
;;     PRE: k &gt;= 1
;;     POST: produce an Int &gt;= 1
;; (sum-first k) produces the sum of the integers 1..k
(define (sum-first k)
    ...)</code></pre>
<p>Note that preconditions and postconditions are part of the contract, not their own element. The preconditions are the conditions that must be true before calling the function, and the postconditions are the conditions that will be true after the function is called - a specification of what the function produces.</p>
<p>More complex preconditions and postconditions should be written as English sentences describing what the data should look like.</p>
<p>This allows the contract to convey more information about what is allowed: following the preconditions and obeying the contract while calling the function results in the postconditions being met. These conditions are both logical statements.</p>
<p>A function that takes no parameters has a contract that starts off something like <code>FUNCTION_NAME: -&gt; RETURN_VALUE</code>.</p>
<p>A precondition that is always met no matter what can be written as <code>PRE: #t</code>. Likewise with postconditions.</p>
<p>In Racket, there are even built in facilities in the language that help enforce the preconditions and postconditions. However, we will not be using them - the conditions in our programs will be informal.</p>
<h1 id="tutorial-1">13/1/14 - Tutorial</h1>
<p>Review of differences between teaching languages use in CS135 and the full version of Racket:</p>
<ul>
<li>DrRacket should be set to &quot;Determine language from source&quot; and Racket source fiiles should start with <code>#lang racket</code>. This is often omitted in the course notes.</li>
<li>Functions can be defined that do not accept any parameters: <code>(define (x) 27)</code>, <code>(x)</code> =&gt; <code>27</code>.</li>
<li>Racket programs are sequences of definitions and top-level expressions (expressions that are not inside of a definition). When a program is run, it is evaluated top to bottom, binding each definition to its value and evaluating each top-level expression.</li>
<li><code>#t</code> and <code>#f</code> are the boolean literals, and <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> are constants defined to <code>#t</code> and <code>#f</code>, respectively. All <strong>non-false values are treated as true</strong>.
<ul>
<li><code>(and a b ... y z)</code> returns <code>#f</code> if all arguments false, <code>#t</code> if no arguments, otherwise the last argument.</li>
<li><code>(or a b ... y z)</code> returns the first non-false argument if there is one, and <code>#f</code> otherwise.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>cond</code> does not produce an error if all the questions in the question/answer pairs are false, instead producing <code>#&lt;void&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>We are allowed to use <code>(if condition evaluate-if-true evaluate-if-false)</code>, which is equivalent to <code>(cond [condition evaluate-if-true] [else evaluate-if-false])</code>.</li>
<li>Structures can now be defined with <code>struct</code> in addition to <code>define-struct</code>, and constructors are named the same as the struct without the <code>make-</code> prefix. FOr example, <code>make-posn</code> is now <code>posn</code>.
<ul>
<li>To make testing easier, we should use <code>#:transparent</code> in the structure definitions, which allows us to see what's inside the structure when printing them out: <code>(struct posn (x y) #:transparent)</code>.</li>
<li>By default, structures are <strong>opaque</strong>, which means when when we display them using something like <code>printf</code>, we can see inside the fields.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We should be familiar with <code>cons</code>, <code>list</code>, <code>empty</code>, <code>first</code>, <code>rest</code>, <code>list-ref</code>, <code>length</code>, <code>append</code>, and <code>reverse</code>. Later on, also <code>last</code> and <code>drop-right</code>.
<ul>
<li><code>(list-ref list n)</code> returns the <code>n</code>-th element of <code>list</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Racket allows one to cons a value to <strong>any other value</strong>, even a non-list value.</li>
<li>Racket does not have <code>member?</code>, but <code>(member value list)</code> returns <code>#f</code> if <code>value</code> is not in <code>list</code>, otherwise the list starting at the first occurrence of <code>value</code> in <code>list</code>: <code>(member 3 '(1 2 3 4))</code> =&gt; <code>'(3 4)</code>.</li>
<li>Functions are still first-class values, and we are expected to be familiar with <code>filter</code>, <code>map</code>, <code>foldr</code>, <code>foldl</code>, and <code>build-list</code>.</li>
<li><code>check-expect</code> is no longer available - we can use <code>equal?</code> for now.</li>
</ul>
<p>The scope of an identifier is the region in the code where it is available for use - the locations where it is visible. <code>local</code> creates a new scope where local definitions are bound to the scope of the <code>local</code>'s extents.</p>
<p>Scopes of top-level definitions are <strong>global</strong>, and scopes of function parameters and local definitions are <strong>local</strong>.</p>
<p>The scope of a definition usually starts where it is defined, and ends at the end of the block where it resides in, excluding any nested local scopes where it is shadowed by a local definition in the nested scope:</p>
<pre><code>; c is not available here
(define c 3)
; c is available here
(local [(define c 4)]
    c) ; this is a different c, and the original c is not available here
; c is available here</code></pre>
<p>Definitions made inside a function body are implicitly local:</p>
<pre><code>(define (f x)
    (define c 10) ; this is a local definition
    (add1 c))</code></pre>
<p>The above is equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code>(define (f x)
    (local [(define c 10)] ; this is a local definition
        (add1 c)))</code></pre>
<p>There is an <strong>implicit local</strong> in the body of every function, so all definitions inside a function body are assumed to be local to the function.</p>
<h1 id="section-2">14/1/14</h1>
<p>Racket modules should have their interfaces at the top of the file.</p>
<p>In the implementation, we do not need to rewrite the documentation for the stuff that is provided.</p>
<p>Functions that are not provided should have their contract and purposes included with them.</p>
<p>The top of the file should be visible only to the client, while the rest is for the developer only.</p>
<p>Example module (<code>sum.rkt</code>):</p>
<pre><code>;; A module for summing numbers [description of module] ; description should appear on the first line

(provide sum-first sum-squares) ;; [list of functions]

;; sum-first: Int -&gt; Int
;;     PRE: k &gt;= 1
;;     POST: produce an Int &gt;= 1
;; (sum-first k) produces the sum of the integers 1..k

;; sum-squares: ...

;;;;;;;;;; IMPLEMENTATION ;;;;;;;;;;

;; see interface above [no further info required] ; functions that are provided should not have their documentation rewritten
(define (sum-first n) ...)

;; private-helper: Int -&gt; Int
;; [contract &amp; purpose for private helper function]
(define (private-helper p) ...)</code></pre>
<p>Locally defined functions should also have their contracts and purposes.</p>
<p>We cannot redefine stuff with the same identifier. To simulate this, we can use local scopes.</p>
<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<p>Racket has no <code>check-expect</code>, and we are to avoid using top-level expressions. How do we do testing?</p>
<p>A good solution is to use testing modules. For example, for the <code>sum.rkt</code> module, we might write <code>test-sum.rkt</code>:</p>
<pre><code>;; this is a simple testing module for sum.rkt

(require &quot;sum.rkt&quot;)

; Each of the following should produce #t

(equal? (sum-first 1) 1)
(equal? (sum-first 2) 3)
(equal? (sum-first 3) 6)
(equal? (sum-first 10) 55)
(equal? (sum-first 99) 4950)</code></pre>
<p>To test private functions, it might be useful to provide testing functions, like <code>test-sum</code> for the <code>sum</code> module.</p>
<h2 id="interface-design">Interface Design</h2>
<p>The goals of interface module design are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>High Cohesion</strong>: everything in the module works towards a common goal - they are related to each other and generally work together.
<ul>
<li>For example, a university course should focus on a single subject, and not jump around from ancient history to mathematics. This is low cohesion - the</li>
<li>Cohesion makes it easier to understand individual modules.</li>
<li>The thermostat should not control the garage door.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Low Coupling</strong>: modules do not interact between each other - module A should not depend on module B if module B depends on module A.
<ul>
<li>Dependency loops mean that the module can't be separated from any of the others in the loop, which makes them highly coupled and poorly designed.</li>
<li>An example of high coupling might be a university course with a lot of prerequisites, co-requisites, and etc. The courses in this example are highly coupled.</li>
<li>Coupling makes testing and understanding the code more difficult.</li>
<li>The car should start even if the radio doesn't work.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Information Hiding</strong>: the interface should be designed to hide the details of the implementation.
<ul>
<li>This is for purposes of <strong>flexibility</strong> allowing us to change the implementation without affecting the client</li>
<li>We also do this for <strong>security</strong> - protecting secret information or preventing tampering or protecting the client from themselves.</li>
<li>The only way a client should be able to interact with the module should be <strong>through the interface</strong>.</li>
<li>A battery's interface should not rely on it using nickel metal-hydride - we should be able to change the chemistry of the battery without affecting it interface.</li>
<li>A user account manager should not expose usernames and passwords to the client. We should also be able to swap out the data structure it uses (like from lists to structs) without the client noticing.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>;wip: it seems like the Boolean in CS135 is changed to Bool</p>
<h3 id="abstract-data-types">Abstract Data Types</h3>
<p>On a related topic, an <strong>abstract data type</strong> (ADT) is simply a module, that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is meant for data storage.</li>
<li>The client can only access through the interface functions (called &quot;ADT operations&quot;).</li>
<li>The data structure and implementation of the ADT is hidden from the client.</li>
</ul>
<p>A <strong>collection ADT</strong> is one that can store an arbitrary number of items, and is generalized to be able to store many different types of items.</p>
<p>An example of this is a dictionary, which maps keys to values.</p>
<p>In some contexts, referring to an &quot;ADT&quot; is the same thing as referring to a &quot;collection ADT&quot; in this context - there are no such things as non-collection ADTs in these contexts.</p>
<p>Not all modules store data, and not all data storage modules are ADTs.</p>
<h3 id="balance">Balance</h3>
<p>Security and flexibility is good. But so is transparency - exposing various details of the implementation to empower the client to do more with the module.</p>
<p>Interface design involves a lot of tradeoffs between things like the amount of information hiding used in order to make the best possible interface for a given set of requirements.</p>
<h2 id="functional-c">Functional C</h2>
<p>We now move to C programming. We will only be using the features that also exist in Racket for now to make the transition easier.</p>
<p>C was designed to be a portable systems programming language that is easy to translate into machine code.</p>
<p>It is designed to give low-level access to computer memory, while still being easy to port to other machines.</p>
<p>We use the C99 standard in this course, finalized in 1999.</p>
<p>Just as Racket can be used in an imperative way, C can be programmed in a functional way, using the functional programmming paradigm.</p>
<p>Comments in Racket:</p>
<pre><code>; single line comment
#|
multi-line
comment
|#</code></pre>
<p>Comments in C:</p>
<pre><code>// single line comment

/*
multi-line
comment
*/</code></pre>
<p>Racket constant: <code>(define n 42)</code> C constant: <code>const int n = 42;</code></p>
<p><code>const</code> indicates the variable is <strong>immutable</strong>, and <code>int</code> indicates that the variable is an <strong>integer</strong>. The <code>= 42</code> is the <strong>initializer</strong>. The whole thing together is a <strong>definition</strong>.</p>
<p>All definitions in C end with a semicolon.</p>
<p>Identifiers must sart with a letter or underscore, and can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores.</p>
<p>We will use <code>underscore_case</code> for our variable names.</p>
<p>Racket uses <strong>dynamic typing</strong> - the type of an identifier is determined while the program is running, which allows us to <strong>change its type at runtime</strong>. C uses <strong>static typing</strong> - the type of an identifier is determined before the program runs, which means that the type of an identifier <strong>cannot be changed while the program is running</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, in C, we cannot define an integer constant, and later set it to a string. However, this is entirely possible in Racket.</p>
<p>Because types cannot be changed and are always explicit in the code, we no longer need to check the input types like we did in Racket (<code>integer?</code>, <code>false?</code>, etc.).</p>
<p>In C, all constants (immutable variables) <strong>must be initialized</strong>. All mutable variables <strong>should be initialized</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="operators">Operators</h3>
<p>C uses infix notation for expressions, similar to math, and expression operators all have their own precedences (conceptually similar to order of operations in math):</p>
<pre><code>const int k = 3 + 4 * 2; // `k` is now 11
const int l = (3 + 4) * 2; // `l` is now 14</code></pre>
<p>Note that parentheses now serve only to group things together, and otherwise have no syntactic significance.</p>
<p>If an expression is ambiguous or confusing, use parentheses to make it clearer.</p>
<h1 id="section-3">16/1/14</h1>
<p>In C, operators such as addition and division are distinct from functions in syntax and functionality. The order of operations is similar to those in math.</p>
<p>Operators are distinct language constructs with their own rules for syntax. They are described in detail in the textbook. Operators may have different associtivities and precedences.</p>
<p>C has almost 50 operators in total, many of which work on data.</p>
<p>The <code>a / b</code> operator in C over integers divides two numbers, always rounding towards 0. It behaves similar to <code>quotient</code> in Racket.</p>
<p>The <code>a % b</code> operator in C behaves the same as the <code>remainder</code> function in Racket. With negative numbers, C can give confusing results - <strong>avoid using negative numbers</strong> for this reason.</p>
<p>In Racket, we <strong>apply</strong> a function, which <strong>consumes</strong> arguments and <strong>produces</strong> a value.</p>
<p>In C, we <strong>call</strong> a function, which is <strong>passed</strong> arguments and <strong>returns</strong> a value.</p>
<h3 id="functions">Functions</h3>
<p>Racket:</p>
<pre><code>; my-sqr: Int -&gt; Int
(define (my-sqr x)
    (* x x))</code></pre>
<p>C:</p>
<pre><code>// my_sqr(x) squares `x`
//     PRE:  true
//     POST: return value &gt;= 0
int my_sqr(int x) {
    return x * x;
}</code></pre>
<p>The curly braces indicate the function <strong>block</strong>, the body of the function.</p>
<p>The type of every value must be specified explicitly. The <code>return</code> statement is mandatory for functions that have non-void return types.</p>
<p>As a result, errors like <code>(my-sqr &quot;a&quot;)</code> in Racket give a runtime error, while in C, this is caught by the compiler - contract violations cannot exist.</p>
<p>We call functions in a way similar to defining them:</p>
<pre><code>// my_add(x, y) adds `x` and `y`
//     PRE:  true
//     POST: true
int my_add(x, y) {
    return x + y;
}

// my_num() returns 42
//     PRE:  true
//     POST: return value == 42
int my_num(void) { // `void` here means there are no parameters
    return my_add(40, 2);
}</code></pre>
<p>In C, our function documentation starts with the purpose and doesn't need the contract (due to static typing). The preconditions and postconditions are still necessary.</p>
<h3 id="entry-point">Entry Point</h3>
<p>The <strong>entry point</strong> is the place where we start running the program.</p>
<p>In Racket, the entry point of the program is the top of the file being run.</p>
<p>In C, the entry point of the program is the body of the <code>main</code> function. Every C program must have a <code>main</code> function.</p>
<p><code>main</code> has no parameters (for now) and an <code>int</code> return type to indicate if the program was successful (zero) or not (non-zero).</p>
<pre><code>// no documentation is required!
int main(void) {
    // program starts here
    // this is the only typed function where we can omit the return value and it will assume 0 (success)
}</code></pre>
<h3 id="library">Library</h3>
<p>C has no built-in functions. However, it has a lot of modules that are almost always available.</p>
<p>First C program:</p>
<pre><code>// first C program

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void) {
    printf(&quot;Hello, World!\n&quot;);
}</code></pre>
<p>In C, <code>printf</code> uses different placeholders for each type, and the placeholder specifier (<code>~</code> in Racket) is <code>%</code>. A literal percent sign is <code>%%</code>. As with Racket, the number of extra arguments needs to match the number of placeholders:</p>
<pre><code>printf(&quot;I am 100%% sure that %d + %d = %d&quot;, 2, 2, 5);</code></pre>
<p><code>printf</code> is found in a lot of computer languages, and it has mmuch more functionaity than is covered here. For example:</p>
<pre><code>printf(&quot;%04d&quot;, 42); // prints 0042, length 4 with &quot;0&quot; padding</code></pre>
<h3 id="top-level">Top-level</h3>
<p>In C, top-level expressions are invalid, except for ones resulting in constant values:</p>
<pre><code>// top level

const int a = 3 * 3 // valid
const int b = my_sqr(4) // invalid
3 * 3; //invalid
my_sqr(4); //invalid</code></pre>
<p>We can still use expressions inside definitions inside of functions: <code>int main(void) { const int a = my_sqr(4); }</code>.</p>
<h3 id="booleans">Booleans</h3>
<p>In C, False is represented by 0, and any non-zero value is considered True.</p>
<p>Equality testing in C is done using <code>a == b</code>, resulting in 1 or 0. The <code>a = b</code> is for <strong>assignment only</strong> and is one of the most common C errors.</p>
<p>Non-equality testing in C is done using <code>a != b</code>, resulting in 1 or 0. Negation is done using <code>!a</code>.</p>
<p>Logical AND is done using <code>a &amp;&amp; b</code>, and logical OR is done using <code>a || b</code>, both returning 1 or 0. Like in Racket, they short-circuit with the same rules. Remember to use <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>||</code> rather than <code>&amp;</code> and <code>|</code>, which are bitwise operators and do different things.</p>
<p>The <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;=</code> operators are self-explanatory.</p>
<p>Note that <code>&gt;</code> has a higher precedence than <code>==</code>, so <code>1 == 3 &gt; 0</code> is <code>1 == (3 &gt; 0)</code>, which could be confusing. Always use parentheses when there is the possibility of confusion.</p>
<p>The <code>a ? b : c</code> is known as the <strong>ternary operator</strong>. It works like <code>(if a b c)</code> in Racket. If <code>a</code> is true, it evaluates and returns <code>b</code>, otherwise <code>c</code>. It short-circuits, so one of <code>b</code> or <code>c</code> is not evaluated: <code>x &gt;= 0 ? x : -x</code> results in the absolute value.</p>
<p>Like in Racket, we must define a function before we can call it. However, C needs to know the type signature of the function</p>
