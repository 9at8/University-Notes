Algorithm Design and Data Abstraction.

    Instructor: Dave Tompkins
    Section 003

The [Course Website](https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs136/) is expected to be checked by each student at least once a day. ;wip: set up the reminder later

# 6/1/14 - Tutorial

This course covers Racket for the first part, and then C and abstract concepts for the rest.

# 7/1/14

The clicker ID for the room is CB, but the prof just said he'll use AA.

Assignments usually due every week Wednesday at noon.

;wip: look around the website, and get a copy of the textbook next week, the electronic one

If you don't want to use the clickers, enter your student number as the clicker ID and you can pass assignment 0.

Every clicker question is out of 2, best 75% of responses counted, every tutorial attend increases final grade 0.1%, but is part of clamped 5% participation grade.

Assignments are to be submitted to [Marmoset](http://marmoset.student.cs.uwateroo.ca/). MarkUs is used too for viewing comments, but students submit to Marmoset. There is less hand marking in this course and more automated testing.

Assignments must be done individually. Do not share or discuss code, not even the strategies.

We are using C with Clang/LLVM (in the RunC environment) and Racket (full Racket, not the teaching languages). Mostly C, though.

RunC works with C and Racket, helps testing, and offers improved error messages.

Lab hours are Tuesdays at 10am to 6pm in MC3003. They give help setting up the environment if needed.

Design Recipes
--------------

Design recipes help design new functions from scratch, and aid communication by providing documentation.

Because we are now apparently familiar with designing functions, we focus on documentation.

The new design recipe for this course is now:

* Purpose
* Contract

You are also expected to test your code yourself, though they are not required.

Main topics
-----------

* Data structures, abstract data types
* Modularization
* Imperative programming
* Memory management & state
* Algorithm design/efficiency
* Designing medium size, real world programs with I/O

The most common programming paradigms are functional, imperative, object oriented.

Programming involves a lot of **design choices** and **tradeoffs**. Each decision has to be made based on the situation and the requirements.

An abstract data type is a data type with certain properties, but we don't really care how it works. An example would be a dictionary/mapping - we only care about lookup, insert, and remove, not whether it uses association lists or binnary trees or anything.
