Logic
-----

Logic is the science of correct reasoning.  It is concerned with determining whether things are true or false.

In **symbolic logic**, we use symbols to represent truth values and manipulate logical statements using certain logical rules.

This course deals with propositional logic, predicate logic, and program verification.

Prove that $3 \mid (4^n + 5)$ for all $n \in \mb{N}$:

> Clearly, this is true for $n = 0$, since $3 \mid (1 + 5)$.  
> Assume for some $k \ge 0$ that $3 \mid (4^k + 5)$.  
> So $\exists p \in \mb{Z}, 3p = 4^k + 5$ and $4(3p) = 4(4^k + 5)$, so $12p - 15 = 3(4p - 5) = 4^{k + 1} + 5$.  
> Let $q = 4p - 5$. Since $q \in \mb{Z}$, $\exists q \in \mb{Z}, 3q = 4^{k + 1} + 5$.  
> So $3 \mid 4^{k + 1} + 5$, and by induction, $3 \mid 4^n + 5$ for all $n \in \mb{N}$.  

The idea is that with strong induction, we can use any of the previous cases to prove the inductive hypothesis.
