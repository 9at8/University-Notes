Logic
-----

Logic is the science of correct reasoning.  It is concerned with determining whether things are true or false.

In **symbolic logic**, we use symbols to represent truth values and manipulate logical statements using certain logical rules.

This course deals with propositional logic, predicate logic, and program verification.

Prove that $3 \mid (4^n + 5)$ for all $n \in \mb{N}$:

> Clearly, this is true for $n = 0$, since $3 \mid (1 + 5)$.  
> Assume for some $k \ge 0$ that $3 \mid (4^k + 5)$.  
> So $\exists p \in \mb{Z}, 3p = 4^k + 5$ and $4(3p) = 4(4^k + 5)$, so $12p - 15 = 3(4p - 5) = 4^{k + 1} + 5$.  
> Let $q = 4p - 5$. Since $q \in \mb{Z}$, $\exists q \in \mb{Z}, 3q = 4^{k + 1} + 5$.  
> So $3 \mid 4^{k + 1} + 5$, and by induction, $3 \mid 4^n + 5$ for all $n \in \mb{N}$.  

The idea is that with strong induction, we can use any of the previous cases to prove the inductive hypothesis.

Propositional Logic
-------------------

The language of propositions is propositional logic.

A proposition is a declarative statement that is either true or false. It may depend on the context, like how the proposition $x \ge 5$ depends on the contextual variable $x$.

We always assume that for any proposition with its context (the situation the proposition applies in), either the proposition is true, or it is false, and it cannot be both. If a statement is false, then its negation is true.

Propositions must be declarative. They must make sense when we ask, "is it true that PROPOSITION?". It must be assignable to either true or false.

**Simple/atomic propositions** are the building blocks of **compound propositions**. For example, "It is currently raining in Waterloo" and "It is currently 12 degrees Celsius in Waterloo" are simple propositions, and "It is either raining or 12 degrees in Waterloo" is a compound proposition.

Atomic ropositions are the smallest possible statements that are still propositions. They cannot be divided into smaller propositions.

### Expression Syntax

The propositional language is known as $\mathcal{L}_P$. This language contains **atoms**, which are lowercase Latin characters such as $p$, $q$, and $r$, optionally with subscripts. These all belong to the set $\operatorname{Atom}(\mathcal{L}_P)$, so $p \in \operatorname{Atom}(\mathcal{L}_P)$.

There are also **punctuation** symbols, the round parentheses "(" and ")", which change the precendence of subexpressions.

There are also **connectives**, which are $\neg, \wedge, \vee, \rightarrow, \leftrightarrow$.

An **expression** is a finite sequence of symbols. The length of an expression is the number of symbols it contains. Expressions may not necessarily be valid, like $( \vee \neg \vee ($.

The empty expression (containing no symbols) is denoted $\emptyset$.

### Expression Operations

Let $U, V, W$ be expressions. Then $U$ and $V$ are equal ($U = V$) if and only if they contain the same sequence of symbols.

Then $UV$ is the concatenation of $U$ and $V$ - the expression containing the entire sequence in $U$, followed by the entire sequence in $V$.

If $U = W_1 V W_2$, then $V$ is a **segment** of $U$ - it is a sequence of symbols that $U$ also contains. All sequences contain the empty expression.

If $V$ is a segment of $U$ and $V \ne U$, then $V$ is a **proper segment** of $U$.

If $U = VW$, then $V$ is an **initial segment** and $W$ is a **terminal segment**.

### Expression Validity

The binary (two-parameter) connectives are $\wedge, \vee, \rightarrow, \leftrightarrow$. In the following, $\odot$ will represent any arbitrary one of these binary connectives. The only connective that is not binary is the unary $\neg$ connective.

The set of **formulas** is the set of all valid/well-formed expressions, and is denoted $\operatorname{Form}(\mathcal{L}_P)$. Given $A, B \in \operatorname{Form}(\mathcal{L}_P)$, we can define $\operatorname{Form}(\mathcal{L}_P)$ as follows:

* $\operatorname{Atom}(\mathcal{L}_P) \subseteq \operatorname{Form}(\mathcal{L}_P)$ - all atoms are formulas.
* $\neg A \in \operatorname{Form}(\mathcal{L}_P)$ - the negation of any formula is also a formula (the set of formulas are closed under negation).
* $A \odot B \in \operatorname{Form}(\mathcal{L}_P)$ - binary connectives applied to two formulas are also formulas (the set of formulas is closed under all the binary connectives).

Formulas are often represented using Roman capital letters.

Theorem 2.2.3 states the obvious consequences of the definition: all formulas of $\mathcal{L}_P$ are atoms, or of the form $\neg A, A \wedge B, A \vee B, A \rightarrow B, A \leftrightarrow B$.

Let $R(n)$ be a property (true if the property holds for $n$, false otherwise). Theorem 2.2.4 states that if $\forall p \in \operatorname{Atom}(\mathcal{L}_P), R(p)$ and $\forall A \in \operatorname{Form}(\mathcal{L}_P), R(A) \implies R(\neg A)$ and $\forall A, B \in \operatorname{Form}(\mathcal{L}_P), R(A) \wedge R(B) \implies R(A \odot B)$, then $\forall A \in \operatorname{Form}(\mathcal{L}_P), R(A)$.

In other words, if a property holds for all the forms of formulas, then it holds for all formulas.

The **type** of a formula is determined by its top-level operator. For example, $\neg A$ is a negation, $A \wedge B$ is conjunction, $A \vee b$ is a disjunction, $A \rightarrow B$ is an implication, $A \leftrightarrow B$ is an equivalence. According to theorem 2.3.3, all formulas must be one of these forms.

We want to be able to look at any expression and determine whether it is well formed. For example, $\neg()$ is not a well formed formula (WFF) because it is not obtainable through the rules that define an element in the set of formulas.

Is $(\neg a) \wedge (b \vee c)$ well formed?

> We can first notice that this is of the form $P \wedge Q$, where $P = \neg a$ and $Q = b \vee c$. By the rules, we know that the whole thing is well formed if and only if $P$ and $Q$ are both well formed.  
> Now we check if $P$ is well formed. Clearly, it is of the form $\neg R$, where $R = a$, and $a$ is an atom (which is, by definition, well formed), so by the rules, $\neg a$ is well formed.  
> Now we check if $Q$ is well formed. Clearly, it is of the form $S \vee T$, where $S = b$ and $T = c$. By the rules, $Q$ is well formed if and only if $S$ and $T$ are. Since they are atoms, they are both well formed by definition.  
> Since $P$ and $Q$ are well formed, $P \wedge Q$ is well formed and so is $(\neg a) \wedge (b \vee c)$.

Parse Trees
-----------

The other way of testing for well-formedness is by constructing a parse tree out of the symbols in the formula. The top-level operator or atom is the root node of the tree, and the operands are its children. This is repeated until all the symbols have been added to the tree. Parentheses simply change the arrangement of the nodes and are not included in the parse tree.

For example, the expression $(((\neg p) \wedge q) \rightarrow (p \wedge (q \vee (\neg r))))$ has the following parse tree:

          \implies
           /   \
          /     \
      \wedge   \wedge
       /  \     /  \
    \neg   q   p  \vee
      |           /  \
      p          q  \neg
                      |
                      r

Every parse tree is unique. The rules for a valid formula can be applied to a parse tree to test for well-formedness:

* Tree nodes must be either atoms or connectives.
* If a node is an atom, it cannot have any children - if a node has children, it must be a connective.
* If a node is the unary connective ($\neg$), then it must have exactly one child.
* If the node is a binary connective, then it must have exactly two children.
* If a tree is empty, then it is not a well formed formula.

An algorithm for testing if an expression $U$ is a well formed formula is given below

1. If $U$ is empty, produce False.
2. If $U \in \operatorname{Atom}(\mathcal{L}_P)$, then produce True.
3. If the expression does not begin with a $($ symbol, produce False.
4. If the second symbol is $\neg$, then let $V$ be an expression such that $U = (\neg V)$. Apply this algorithm again with $V$ as the expression, and if it is false, produce False.
5. Otherwise (the second symbol is not $\neg$), apply this algorithm again with all the symbols starting from and including the second symbol, except doing nothing in step 7. If it results in False, return False. Otherwise, let $V$ be the well formed formula from the second symbol to wherever the algorithm run ended. If the next symbol after this is not a binary connective, produce False. Do the formula thing again to get a well formed formula $W$, or produce False.
6. If the symbol after the place $W$ ended is not a $)$ symbol, produce False.
7. If the expression does not end after the $)$ symbol, produce False.
8. Produce True.

This algorithm gets applied a finite number of times, proportional to the depth of the tree.

The **height** of a parse tree is the length of the longest path from the root to a leaf.

### Precedence

We now introduce a system of precedence. The logical connectives listed by priority, from highest to lowest, are $\neg$, $\wedge$, $\vee$, $\rightarrow$, and $\leftrightarrow$.

Precedence is the idea that some connectives get higher priority than others. For example, $p \vee q \wedge r$ could potentially mean either $((p \vee q) \wedge r)$, or $(p \vee (q \wedge r))$. But since $\wedge$ has a higher precedence than $\vee$, we define $p \vee q \wedge r$ to mean $(p \vee (q \wedge r))$.

When there are multiple ambiguities, we start with the ones with highest precedence. For example, $\neg p \wedge q \vee r$ is resolved to $(neg p) \wedge q \vee r$, then $(((neg p) \wedge q) \vee r)$.

**Course of values induction** is a type of strong induction where the inductive hypothesis used to prove the inductive conclusion is the conjunction of all the previous cases.

In other words, we do course of values induction by proving a property holds for $M(1)$, and then by proving that $M(1) \wedge \ldots \wedge M(k) \implies M(k + 1)$ for any $k \ge 1$. By the principal of strong induction, $M(n)$ therefore holds for all $n \ge 1$.

Sometimes we want to use induction on the height of the parse tree. This is often useful for proving things about propositional formulas, due to the recursive nature of formulas.

If a formula $C$ contains the segment $(\neg A)$, where $A$ is another formula, then $A$ is the **scope** of the $\neg$ within $C$. The scope is the area where the $\neg$ applies.

For binary connectives, if $C$ contains $(A \odot B)$ where $\odot$ is a binary connective, then $A$ and $B$ are the left and right scopes, respectively, of the binary connective within $C$.

A scope is unique to the operator. Two operators cannot have the exact same scope, though the scopes themselves can be equal.
