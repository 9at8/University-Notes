For the purposes of the course, a **user interface** is any place where a person expresses **intention** to an artifact, and the artifact presents **feedback** to the person. For example, the panel and the screen/beeper on a microwave is a user interface. In most user interfaces, there is a feedback loop between intention and feedback. We call this the **feedback loop**.

An **event** is an observable occurrence or phenomenon, as well as a message representing the fact that this phenomenon occurred.

An **interface** is what is presented to the user, such as the widgets and controls, much like the intention part of the feedback loop. An **interaction** is an action that the user invokes to perform a task, much like the intention part of the feedback loop.

The important challenges in user interfaces and interaction design largely revolve around accounting for variability - users can have very different levels of expertise, and there are often a huge possible range of tasks to support. Well designed user interfaces empower the user, allowing poeple to do more with the same tools.

This course covers designing and implementing user interfaces, with a focus on desktop and mobile apps. Most of the course will be abot the design and architecture of interfaces, with interaction design as a focus.
