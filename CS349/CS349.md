For the purposes of the course, a **user interface** is any place where a person expresses **intention** to an artifact, and the artifact presents **feedback** to the person. For example, the panel and the screen/beeper on a microwave is a user interface. In most user interfaces, there is a feedback loop between intention and feedback. We call this the **feedback loop**.

An **event** is an observable occurrence or phenomenon, as well as a message representing the fact that this phenomenon occurred.

An **interface** is what is presented to the user, such as the widgets and controls, much like the intention part of the feedback loop. An **interaction** is an action that the user invokes to perform a task, much like the intention part of the feedback loop.

The important challenges in user interfaces and interaction design largely revolve around accounting for variability - users can have very different levels of expertise, and there are often a huge possible range of tasks to support. Well designed user interfaces empower the user, allowing poeple to do more with the same tools.

This course covers designing and implementing user interfaces, with a focus on desktop and mobile apps. Most of the course will be abot the design and architecture of interfaces, with interaction design as a focus.

Assignments are to be submitted using Git on your uWaterloo GitLab account. You should avoid posting assignments online until the course is over, after which you are free to post whatever you like. Make sure to log into your GitLab account before the next class, in order to get your account set up properly.

The X Windows system was one of the first ever standardized UNIX windowing systems. Invented in 1984, it is still being used today in various UNIX-ey systems. X runs as a separate component that the operating system starts and manages, and window managers/games/etc. communicate with it to display windows.

Note that the X Windowing system only provides the windowing primitives, with no specified window manager. These primitives include window creation, input handling, and graphical functionality at a relatively low level. X is also responsible for routing input to the correct window, and making sure only one thing can change the video buffer at a time (since the graphics card can only accept one set of instructions at a time; this is the reason most modern user interfaces are single threaded).

Most window decorations, like title bars and window borders, are handled by the window manager. The window manager controls the look and feel of windows, but not the contents of the application itself.

The X Windows system was designed to work on a variety of displays, allow mirroring and extending displays, device independence, and even network transparency. It was first to standardize the overlapping and resizable window conventions we're used to today.

X separates the user interface and the application - they can actually run on totally different machines, due to the network transparency mentioned previously. Basically, the client is the computer that runs the custom software, and the server is the computer that displays things to the user (intuitively, the server serves up windowing capabilities).

Users express intent to the X server input system. The input systems then update the X clients, which in turn notify the X server output systems. Then, the results are presented back to the user. This can be thought of as an MVC implementation, where the client is the model, the input system is the controller, and the output system is the view.

A typical X client application does the following:

1. Initialize the program.
2. Connect to the X server.
3. Initialize the X portion of the program.
4. Do the event loop:
    1. Get the next input event from the X server (note that the server actually drives the program).
    2. Handle the event (and break the loop if it was an exit event).
    3. Do client work if necessary.
5. Close connection to the X server.
6. Uninitialize the program.

Before windowing systems, we had terminal applications that would take up the entire screen. Windowing systems introduced a new concept: different applications can take up different parts of the screen, and they can all run independently, not having to worry about which parts of the screen they need to draw, how to move/resize themselves, and whether to accept input. For applications, X exposes a buffer for the application to draw into, and a stream of input events for the application to consume.

These days, X is only used on Linux and BSDs - Windows and OS X have their own windowing systems and window managers, and are often not interchangable. However, there is still the fundamental need for the same functionality.

In this course, we will be using Swing with Java. Swing has a different, simpler set of assumptions, and therefore is a lot easier to use for creating most modern applications. For example, modern architectures tend to run directly on the user's computer rather than on a mainframe accessed via a thin client. Here's a simple example:

```java
import javax.swing.*;

public class TestWindow extends JFrame {
    public TestWindow() {
        this.setTitle("Test Window");
        this.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
    }

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        TestWindow testWindow = new TestWindow();
        testWindow.setSize(400, 300);
        testWindow.setVisible(true);
    }
}
```
