<p>Philosophy of math - ten philosophical puzzles about mathematics. This is listed in the undergraduate calendar as &quot;Special Topics&quot;, and there are usually different topics for this course every term.</p>

<h1 id="section">2/5/16</h1>
<p>In this course we discuss 10 mathematical/philisophical puzzles, at a rate of about one per week. There are readings for each topic, and they will be discussed and expanded on in class. The last two puzzles will actually be chosen by the class.</p>
<p>Math and philosophy are both a priori disciplines - we don't have to look at the world itself to learn about it. Math and philosophy also both heavily concern themselves with argumentation - math with proofs, and philosophy with debate.</p>
<h2 id="infinity">Infinity</h2>
<p>What is infinity? Colloquially, it can be said to be a value that is larger than any number that can be conceived of. However, these sorts of explanations tend to run into trouble in practice. Throughout the years, infinity has been described as something that is unlimited, unbounded, or even beyond comprehension.</p>
<p>A <strong>potential infinity</strong> is a process that doesn't end. For example, the natural numbers are a sequence without an ending, and infinity simply denotes the direction that it grows toward, rather than some thing or value we actually reach. An <strong>actual/completed infinity</strong> is an unending quantity that we actually reach - the process actually completes. Most historical philosophers thought that potential infinities exist, but completed infinities do not. Eventually, as the field of mathematics advanced, completed infinities became necessary.</p>
<p>However, accepting completed infinities has some nonintuitive consequences. For example, it was previously thought that for any particular thing, the whole thing would be greater than the sum of its parts. With infinite sized sets, this isn't necessarily true. For example, we can make a bijection between the set <span class="math inline">\(\set{n \middle| n \in \mb{N}}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\set{n + 1 \middle| n \in \mb{N}}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = x + 1\)</span>, yet the second set is only a part of the first (all the same elements, except for <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>). Essentially, even though we took out an item, it seems like the set remained the same size.</p>
<p>Dedikind actually used this to define infinity: as something that is the same size as one of its parts. Anything that doesn't obey &quot;the whole is the same size as the sum of its parts&quot;, he said, would be called infinity.</p>
<p>Cantor had a different view. He started by defining finite as something that could be bijected with some fragment of the natural numbers - that there exists a natural number <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> such that all natural numbers up to <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> can be put in a one to one correspondence to that thing. Then, infinity can be defined as anything that isn't finite.</p>
<p>Cantor also showed, through the diagonalization argument, that positive rational numbers can be bijected with the natural numbers. In other words, the number of fractions is the same as the number of natural numbers. However, note that the numerators and denominators of rational numbers are both also just natural numbers, so the set of natural numbers is the same size as the Cartesian product of the set of natural numbers - there are an &quot;infinity of infinities&quot;, so to speak.</p>
<p>Infinity makes arithmetic weirder. For finite numbers, <span class="math inline">\(ab = bc \wedge b \ne 0 \implies a = c\)</span>, yet this doesn't apply anymore when we start dealing with infinities.</p>
<h2 id="sets-and-foundationalist-mathematics">Sets and Foundationalist Mathematics</h2>
<p>Historically, not all numbers came into use all at once. The natural numbers came first, and then zero (originally used as a placeholder for numbers like 10), and then negative numbers, rational numbers, irrational numbers, and finally, imaginary numbers.</p>
<p>Kronecker argued that we should only say mathematical objects exist if they can be constructed from the integers - rationals being pairs of integers, reals as a sequence of rationals, and so on. To Kronecker, anything that could not be constructed out of integers simply didn't exist.</p>
<p>If we can reduce reals to just integers, and we can reduce integers into natural numbers, and natural numbers into sets, what does this say about those objects' existance? Are reals simply an abbreviation of sets, or are they separate concepts that also exist on their own?</p>
<p>One way to construct natural numbers in terms of sets is to define 1 as the empty set, 2 as the set containing just 1, 3 as the set containing 1 and 2, and so on, each successive number's set containing every predecessor's set. We can easily reduce integers to natural numbers by assigning alternating positive and negative integers to even and odd natural numbers (with the integer 0 being mapped to the natural number 1), and using similar techniques, rational, irrational, and complex numbers. Therefore, all of these numbers can be reduced to sets.</p>
<p>Suppose we say that the existance of sets are pretty much self evident. By reducing things to sets, we can anchor their existance in that of sets, and by doing do learn more about what objects we consider to exist. This is essentially much of the foundationalist work that took place in the late 19th century, as mathematicians attempted to get rid of gotchas and pitfalls in proofs once and for all.</p>
<p>Originally, sets were seen as extensions of concepts, where every well-defined concept defines a set of individuals that belong to that concept. However, this definition has a few issues. One of them is Russel's paradox: suppose we define a set with &quot;something that is not a member of itself&quot;. Does this set contain itself? If it does, then it shouldn't by definition, and if it doesn't, then it should be contained in the set.</p>
<h1 id="section-1">9/5/16</h1>
<h2 id="math-created-or-discoveredz">Math: Created or Discovered?z</h2>
<p>Are mathematical objects created, or discovered? Some people say axioms are created, and everything above that is discovered. Other people say that all math is a creation, while others still yet say math is discovered. <strong>Constructivism</strong> is the view that math is created.</p>
<p>If we ever ran into an advanced alien civilization, we would expect that they would also have mathematics that is quite similar to ours - math seems to be universal. This seems to be evidence that math is discovered, not created. In contrast, something like chess would not be the same across the entire universe, since it's a creation of some random person. Implicit is the assumption that discovery means the thing discovered is universal, while creation means that the thing created is not universal.</p>
<p>On the other hand, mathemeticians can seem to invent new mathematical objects all the time, which appears much like the process of creation. Another possibility is that mathematicians simply think about what to discover, and then discover things within the framework of logic.</p>
<p>Would aliens actually have the same mathematics? We assumed they did, but is it possible for them to have a totally different math?</p>
<p>One view is that to create something, one must change something to bring it into existance. In this view, since math doesn't change the state of the universe, If we go by this definition of creation, then nothing in math is created, only discovered.</p>
<p>One view is that the difference between discovery and creation is the way that they're done. Math is not like science because math requires certainty (through proofs), while science requires only that a high enough standard of certainty is reached.</p>
<p>An argument is a set of claims, one of which, the conclusion is defended by the others, the premises.If you have a valid argument, then to refute the argument, you must first refute the premises.</p>
<p>An arguzment is cogent if the premises support the conclusion, and it's reasonable to believe the premises. By support, we mean that the premises imply that the conclusion is likely (not necessarily that the premises imply that the conclusion is in fact true). When we evaluate philisophical views, we need to evaluate whether the arguments for it are cogent.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a premise isn't reasonably believable by itself. In these cases, we can still make the argument cogent by supprting the premise with a subargument.</p>
<p>Philosophers often end up arguing about things that are quite distant from the original subject. For example, a debate about &quot;should we punish people that don't remember commiting crimes?&quot;, philosophers would quickly end up discussing whether a person with no memory is the same person who committed the crime, whether it is right to punish crimes, and so on.</p>
<p>Philosophy papers are written in a certain context, for a certain audience. They will often respond to earlier authors, which they assume the reader has already read, and that the reader has the appropriate background knowledge shared in the field. This class provides the original papers written for their own contexts, but also tries to provide that context in class and discussions.</p>
<p>Often, philisophical debates revolve around realists vs. anti-realists, like materialists vs phenomenalists, Platonists vs. anti-Platonists, etc</p>
<p>Plato advocated his theory of the Forms, idealized representations of things, like a tree or truth. Forms are timeless, unchanging, perfect versions of anything. Plato thought that there were forms for not only mathematical objects, but also physical objects.</p>
<p>Platonists are realists. Quine, one of the better known Platonists, summarizes it as &quot;to be is to be the value of a variable in a true theory&quot;. In other words, we should believe in the existance of things we can quantify over our best scientific theories. In other words, the things that exist are exactly those things that our best theories of the world say exist (things that correct science says exists).</p>
<p>Platonists say that mathematical objects exist because that because we must use math to formulate our best mathematical theories, mathematical objects must exist.</p>
<p>Plebani argues against the Platonist view of this, that mathematical objects must exist because they are indispensible in our theories of the world. The Plebani reading is essentially a refutation of Quine's argument. He basically says, &quot;even if the premise of math being indispensible is correct, it doesn't support the conclusion that mathematical objects exist&quot;.</p>
<p>Plebani does this by constructing an argument that has the same form, but gives an absurd result - reductio ad absurdum. Plebani formulates Quine's argument in simpler terms:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We can't represent a complex world unless we are using numbers.</li>
<li>Therefore, we can't represent a complex world lacking numbers - numbers must exist!</li>
</ol>
<p>Plebani substitutes some nouns and gets the following absurd argument:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Person A can't see person B unless Person A is using glasses.</li>
<li>Therefore, Person A can't see Person B unless Person B is using glasses.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ernest talks about this divide between realists and anti-realists in more detail, clarifying that anti-realism is not the idea that anything goes in mathematics, but that there are factors outside of purely what exists in the world - mathematics is not purely discovery. To support this, he brings up the effects of Godel's incompleteness theorem in the mathematics community, social influences on mathematics, and exampled of how mathematics has been flawed in the past.</p>
<p>One of the criticisms he addresses is &quot;how can mathematics be invented if it works so perfectly to describe reality?&quot;. To respond, Ernest states that because of social incentives to make it work flawlessly, it would be expected that it would work as well as it did.</p>
