Five assignments, final assignment is worth more. Each assignment has two due dates - the first one we submit test cases, and the second is a week later and we submit code.

This course focuses on object oriented programming and the tools and techniques of software development, with a specific focus on C++.

Linux Shell
-----------

The shell is an interface to the computer. The two main categories are graphical or command-line.

Graphical interfaces are easy to use, but makes it difficult to do complex tasks. They are available on almost every OS.

The command line accepts commands that are typed at the prompt. Windows has a DOS shell, while UNIX has a command line shell. It is possible to do more complex tasks with a command prompt, but it also has poor discoverability and a steep learning curve.

The first shell is Bourne shell, and then Cshell (and its descendent, Turbo shell) and Korn shell came along. Finally, there is Bourne Again Shell, or BASH. Bash is what we use in this course.

We can tell if a shell is Bash by the presence of the `$` before the input prompt.
