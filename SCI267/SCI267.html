<p>Science arose from philosophy. The core areas of philophy are metaphysics (study of the nature of reality), epistemology (study of the theory of knowledge). The philosophy of science is part of epistemology. For example, the frameworks for mathematical physicists vs. those for experimental physicists, and the theoretical physicists between them.</p>
<p>Our goal is to obtain high quality knowledge. The philosophy of science looks into the methods and procedures we use to obtain that knowledge, and how we can improve the quality and quantity of the knowledge we obtain this way. Later on, we will discuss bias, objectivity, and impartiality, and how science is affected by socialogical phenomena.</p>
<p>The textbook is Theory and Reality (2003) by Peter Godfrey-Smith. This is required for the pre-class readings.</p>
<p><strong>Pseudoscience</strong> is a fake science. A common example of this is astrrology - the horoscopes we see in things like newspapers. Some issues with astrology as a science include the fact that it cannot make accurate predicitions, and the predictions are so general that we cannot prove they are false. In other words, astrology is not a science because it is not capable of making precise, accurate predictions.</p>
<h1 id="section-1">9/1/15</h1>
<p>Science includes physics, chemimstry, biology, economics, psychology, and so on as paradigm cases. There are also gray areas such as anthropology. The paradigm cases are paradigm cases because they have been around for a very long time.</p>
<p>Descriptive accounts of science focus on how science works historically, and then attempting to generalize from case studies and observations of existing science.</p>
<p>Normative accounts of science focus on how science should work to help us better obtain data, figure out which methods are better than other, and so on. For example, whether a study should be double blind or not.</p>
<p>In other words, descriptive accounts focus on how science is, and normative focuses on how science should be.</p>
<p>Science is <strong>empirical</strong> - experience is the best source of real knowledge, as opposed to rationalism, which says that the best source of knowledge is from reasoning. However, science uses both empirical evidence and reasoning together to obtain the best information we can.</p>
<p>The <strong>observable-theoretical distinction</strong> is the distinction between what we directly observe, and what is somewhat farther from what we observe. For example, atoms are observable using STM technology, but neutrinos are theoretical, since we have never seen a neutrino with our instruments or senses, only its effects.</p>
<p>The <strong>manifest image</strong> is the image we see with our senses and our instruments. The <strong>scientific image</strong> is the image we see through our scientific theory. These can often differ as more of our scientific conclusions come from indirect observations. For example, quantum mechanics tells us that particles can simply wink into and out of existance, which goes against what we directly observe with our senses.</p>
<p>The <strong>scientific revolution</strong>, which occurred around 1550-1700, was a huge upheaval in the way humans observe how the world works, with impacts on everything from science to medicine. Before this, we had Aristotelian physics and Ptolemiac astronomy. After, we had Newtonian physics, with contributions from Galileo, Descartes, Newton, Copernicus, Kepler, and so on.</p>
<p>Ptolemiac astronomy was geocentric with perfectly spherical orbits of planets and stars around the earth. There is only perfect motion in the heavens, since the heavens are perfect. The stars are perfect and make of quintessence beyond the moon.</p>
<p>It was observed that occasionally planets would appear to go backwards in their orbits. Ptolemiac astronomy, in response to this, introduces epicycles, which were circular orbits orbiting around deferent cycles, which were the larger circles around the earth.</p>
<p>Ptolemy's model actually did a decent job of predicting the motion of the planets. In fact, it was used in naval navigation to quite a bit of success.</p>
<p>Copernicus' heliocentric model was a radical shift, putting the sun at the center of the solar system, though the orbits were still perfectly circular. The advent of these new models also resulted in changes to physics, such as Kepler's calculations for orbital parameters like velocity and orbital radius.</p>
<p>This received massive amounts of backlash. The dominant religion at the time being Catholicism, it was believed that humans had a special place in the universe, and so were at the center. Further, since the heavens were the domain of the Catholic God, the heavens must then be perfect.</p>
<p>Galileo Galilei made big contributions to observational astronomy and physics, known for inventing the telescope and his experiments with falling objects. His observations of the heavenly bodies being imperfect resulted in his prosecution and later on, he was put into house arrest for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>In his &quot;Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems&quot;, he discusses geocentrism vs. heliocentrism as a dialogue between three people - Salviati, a mouthpiece for Galileo; Simplicio, an Aristotelian, and Sagredo, an educated layman/inserted audience member. Interesting, by being written in Italian, this was more widely accessible to the wider Italian speaking population, which angered the Catholic Church, despite Galileo being a Catholic.</p>
<p>The first argument in the excerpt is that the moon is not perfectly smooth because when we have a flat mirror vs a diffuse wall, the flat mirror is only bright from one location, while the wall is bright regardless of what angle we observe it from. The rejoinder is that the moon is not flat, but a sphere.</p>
<p>The second argument is that a spherical mirror would only reflect a single point of light to any observer, since only a tiny point would be directly reflecting toward the observer. As a result, to us the moon would appear as so small a point as to be invisible. This point is emphasized by an experiment with the brightness of the wall not changing when introducing a spherical mirror.</p>
<p>Galileo at this point says that experiments and the experiences of the senses are more important than conclusions derived from plausible assumptions. This was an important part of the scientific revolution - the empirical discovery of new knowledge about the world, by doing rather than thinking about what seems correct.</p>
<p>The other sections of the book deal with the earth moving, and the sun being motionless at the center of the world.</p>
<p>Robert Boyle, among his contributions to physics (Boyle's law), also set some ground rules for what counts as a scientific explanation - a phenomenon must have a mechanical explanation.</p>
<p>Boyle introduced the concept of qualities. For example, primary qualities include size, bulk, shape, motion, and so on, while secondary qualities are the interactions between primary qualities, such as color, taste, solubility, and so on.</p>
<h1 id="section-2">14/1/15</h1>
<p>Empiricism is the view that all real knowledge is empirical - the only source of real knowledge is experience.</p>
<p>Rudolph Carnap was a physicist, and the author of &quot;The Elimination of Metaphysics Through Logical Analysis of Language&quot;. In this article, he states that all statements in metaphysics (including philosophy of ethics and moral philosophy) are entirely meaningless, and that he will justify this using logical analysis of the language used by metaphysicists.</p>
<p>This ties in to science in that analysis of the language used by science would potentially improve the quality of our knowledge - that we can make sure all our statements are meaningful.</p>
<p>For example, he says Heidegger's passage, &quot;What is to be investigated is being only - and nothing else; being alone and further - nothing; solely being, and beyond being - nothing. What about this nothing? [...] Does the Nothing exist only because the Not, i.e., the Negation, exists? [...] What about this nothing? - the Nothing itself nothings.&quot;.</p>
<p>Carnap says there are meaningful and meaningless uses of words - <strong>the verifiability theory of meaning</strong>. For example, &quot;God&quot; could refer to certain mythological beings, which would be meaningful, while a meaningless use would be something like a thing that is beyond experience. In other words, <strong>a sentence about the world has meaning if and only if it is possible, in theory, to make observations that count as evidence for the truth or falsity of the sentence</strong>. That means that sentences that are not about the world could also be meaningful or not, and does not depend on observations about the world.</p>
<p>In other words, sentences about the world have meaning if they are verifiable by observation, and statements that are not about the world are meaningful if they are analytic judgements, or contradictions of analytic judgements (statements that are false because of its meaning itself, like &quot;One equals two.&quot;).</p>
<p>A <strong>pseudosentence</strong> is a sentence that is meaningless as per Carnap's definition. Meaning is the result of a sentence being somehow connected to something that we can observe.</p>
<p>Sentences can be meaningless because they don't make sense, like &quot;Caesar is a prime number&quot;, or perhaps because they are not verifiable, like &quot;God is a being with power beyond observation.&quot; - there are no observations we could make to verify this. A meaningful sentence might be, &quot;Anthropodes are animals with segmented bodies and jointed legs.&quot; - it is easy to look at animals and see if they are anthropodes. Meaningfulness is time dependent - observations that are theoretically possible to make can change over time, like after the invention of the microscope.</p>
<p>Some sentences are meaningful but not directly observable, like &quot;gravity makes objects fall&quot;. Despite the fact that we cannot directly observe gravity, it is connected to and defined in terms of observations that we can observe, therefore giving it meaning. This is the <strong>observational-theoretical distinction</strong> - the difference between what we can directly observe and what we derive from these. All meaningful words of the language can be reduced into other words, and eventually reduced to the words of observation sentences (&quot;protocol sentences&quot;). All sentences that are the result of deduction are theoretical, while all sentences that we directly observe are observational. All theoretical terms must be somehow connected to the observational.</p>
<p>A theoretical sentence might be &quot;atoms are composed of protons, neutrons, and electrons&quot;. While it is not possible to directly observe the protons, neutrons, and electrons, they are part of our scientific theory, which is heavily grounded in observation. The sentence is not a direct result of the observation, but also of scientific theory, which makes it theoretical.</p>
<p>The line is actually rather ill-defined - we use deduction to allow us to assume that what our eyes see actually correspond to what is in the world. For the purposes of analysis, we will give it a very broad definition, all things that are connected to our five senses in some way. For example, what we see through a microscope or telescope cannot directly be observed, but we consider it an observation anyways. Evolution is a theoretical concept since no person has been alive long enough to directly notice it - it is the result of deduction performed on observations.</p>
<p>The <strong>analytic-synthetic distinction</strong> is the distinction between sentences that are true or false because of just their meanings, and those that are true or false because of the way the world is. <strong>Analytic sentences</strong> are those that are true because of their meaning, and are true solely due to their form - they say nothing about reality, and are transformations of factual statements rather than factual statements themselves. In order to gain knowledge about the world, we need to combine them with observations. This includes all of the formulae of mathematics and logic, like &quot;one plus one equals two.&quot; and &quot;a bachelor is an unmarried man&quot;. <strong>Synthetic sentences</strong> are those that are true or false because of both its meaning, and because of the way the world is, like &quot;I ate toast for breakfast this morning&quot;.</p>
<p>According to Carnap, the statements of metaphysics are actually pseudostatements (meaningless), and rather than describing the way the world is, simply express the general attitude of a person towards life. What he is saying is that we should not treat the statements of metaphysics as factual, and not that the field of metaphysics itself should be eliminated.</p>
<p>There has been some criticism of this view. For example, the idea that something is meaningful only if it is connected to observations is a pretty big assumption, and one that rationalists are apt to reject.</p>
<p>There are also scientific statements that are meaningless, like statements about what is in the event horizon of a black hole (we cannot observe beyond the event horizon). It could also be said that it is meaningful because it is connected to the observations we have made outside of the event horizon.</p>
<p>The three types of meaningful sentences are therefore analytic statements, contradictions of analytic statements, and empirical sentences connected to observation.</p>
<p>Logical Empiricism is based on finding meaningful statements that are also true, based on the criteria specified above. It is one possible account of science.</p>
<h1 id="section-3">16/1/15</h1>
<p>The philosophy of science, according to Carnap, should focus exclusively on the logic behind science, not things like scientific history. In other words, philosophers should be focusing on the analytic rather than the synthetic, which should be the domain of the scientists.</p>
<p>This is a normative approach to the philosophy of science, since Carnap is stating that philosophers of science should seek to analyze statements to make sure they are meaningful, and to discard the meaningless theoretical terms and statements - correcting the logical structure of science. In other words, they should focus on validity rather than soundness.</p>
<p>The <strong>normative-descriptive distinction</strong> is the distinction between how science should be, and how it is.</p>
<p>Logical Empiricism is always based on the observations, at its core. For example, saying that a phenomenon is caused by an electron does not mean that there is actually something out there in the world that is an electron, but rather that there appears as though there is a thing that acts like an electron theoretically would causing the phenomenon. An electron is simply a good way to organize our observations.</p>
<p>This is analogous to the aether that earlier scientists believed in. A logical empiricist would say that this is not appropriately related to the observations that later scientists made, and so it has become meaningless in the light of our new observations. As a result, a logical empiricist would discard the meaningless term aether from science, the goal being to trim down science so that scientists can focus on finding meaningful statements.</p>
<p>Carnap's logical empiricism is pragmatic, but does not take into account things like ethics, context of discovery, and much of the descriptive portion of the philosophy of science.</p>
<p>In practice, it is almost impossible to actually satisfy the verifiability principle for many core theoretical principles. In many cases, it is stretching the limit of the &quot;in theory&quot; clause of the verifiability principle in what it is theoretically possible for us to observe.</p>
<p>Some criticisms of logical empiricism include its failure to account for statements like &quot;metals expand when heated or the nothing nothings&quot; that are actually verifiable, even though the second part is totally unverifiable, because an experiment about metals expanding would actually give evidence in favor of the statement as a whole being true, since it is an OR statement.</p>
<p>Logical empiricism is also criticized for looking only at individual sentences, not at a theory at a whole. As a result it misses the bigger idea in the theory, and even ideas that span just a few sentences.</p>
<p>While Carnap is distinguishing between meaningless and meaningful sentences, Popper further distinguishes between good science and bad science.</p>
<h1 id="section-4">21/1/15</h1>
<h2 id="quine">Quine</h2>
<p>Quine presented one of the most well known criticisms of logical empiricism. Quine says that even the parts of science that are analytic are subject to being revised based on empirical evidence, and so even analytic statements are subject to empirical evidence.</p>
<p>As a result, the analytic-synthetic distinction is more of a continuum, with logic and mathematics being more along the line than direct observations.</p>
<p>Truth always depends on language and on facts outside of the language - that the truth of a sentence depends on the meaning of the language, and the meaning applied to the world.</p>
<p>;wip: quiz this wednesday on chapters 1-3 of theory and reality</p>
<p>The goal of the philosophy of science is to have a framework into which we can fit our observations and obtain a certainty for any given hypothesis.</p>
<p>Science is based on <strong>induction</strong> - inferring generalizations using particular observations. This contrasts with deductive logic, which infers specific cases from generalizations.</p>
<p>Deduction is nice because if the premises are true, then the conclusion must necessarily be true. However, we don't find it in science, because we don't have any generalizations that we are certain are true.</p>
<p>Induction is the primary tool we have. In general, it cannot provide certain knowledge, but only become stronger with better and more premises.</p>
<p>Most importantly, David Hume proposed the <strong>problem of induction</strong> - how do we know that future experiences will resemble past and present experiences? Hume states that objects have a secret nature and our mental models of these objects, based on observations, might not be a good representation. By this, it is only habit that leads us to conclude that the sun will rise tomorrow from all our past experiences of the sun rising.</p>
<p>It is the role of the philosophers to check the form, and the scientists to check the content.</p>
<p><strong>Hypothetico-deductivism</strong> is the idea that an observation is deduced from the hypothesis, and is then confirmed by actually making the observation. A confirmation lends inductive support for the hypothesis. Basically, scientists form a hypothesis, make a prediction based on the hypothesis, try to observe the predicted observation, and then confirm the hypothesis with that observation (or reject it if the observation disconfirms it).</p>
<p>Recall the statement &quot;metals expand when heated or the nothing nothings&quot;. In other words, if <span class="math">\(M \implies O\)</span> is a valid deductive argument, then so is <span class="math">\(M \wedge S \implies O\)</span>. This is something Carnap seeks to avoid, since the second clause is a meaningless statement.</p>
