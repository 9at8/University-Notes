<p>Assignments are due every Friday at 3:30pm. They are posted on LEARN.</p>
<p>My own drop box is box 5, slot 12</p>
<p>Midterm is Feb. 24, 7-9pm.</p>
<p>Lecture notes are on the <a href="http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~mscott/euler.htm">course website</a>, posted every week. The password to the website is &quot;euler&quot;. ;wip: get these every week</p>
<p>Course outline:</p>
<ul>
<li>Techniques of integration and applications.</li>
<li>Extensions of single variable calculus - differential equations, vector calculus, etc.</li>
<li>Taylor polynomials</li>
</ul>
<p>Sequence: <span class="math">\(1, 2, 3, \ldots\)</span> Series: <span class="math">\(1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots\)</span></p>
<p>Taylor polynomials are series of functions, which allow us to represent almost any function as a polynomial. This is the most powerful technique in applied mathematics - science and mathematics.</p>
<p>By the way, <span class="math">\(\dee x\)</span> is called an <strong>infinitesmal</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="techniques-of-integration">Techniques of Integration</h2>
<p>Techniques of integration rewrite functions in forms that we can't integrate into forms that we can integrate, or simpler forms that we might be able to apply other techniques on.</p>
<h3 id="method-of-substitution">Method of substitution</h3>
<p>The method of substitution is based on choosing a subexpression <span class="math">\(u\)</span>, and then integrating with respect to it. If <span class="math">\(u\)</span> is chosen carefully, it is occasionally possible to simplify the integral.</p>
<p>This method works best when a <strong>function and its derivative appear in the integrand</strong>.</p>
<p>This works with expressions of the form <span class="math">\(\int f(x) \frac{\dee}{\dee x} f(x) \dee x\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(u = f(x)\)</span>. Since <span class="math">\(\frac{\dee u}{\dee x} = \frac{\dee u}{\dee x}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\dee u = \frac{\dee u}{\dee x} \dee x\)</span> (multiply both sides by <span class="math">\(\dee x\)</span>). This is possible because of infinismals, which work in wierd and wonderful ways. So <span class="math">\(\dee x = \frac{1}{\frac{\dee u}{\dee x}} \dee u\)</span>.</p>
<p>So <span class="math">\(\int f(x) \frac{\dee}{\dee x} f(x) \dee x = \int u \frac{\dee u}{\dee x} \dee x = \int u \frac{\dee u}{\dee x} \frac{1}{\frac{\dee u}{\dee x}} \dee u = \int u \dee u = \frac{u^2}{2} + c = \frac{f(x)^2}{2} + c\)</span>.</p>
<p>Even if we can't simplify it far enough to get an antiderivative, integration by substitution can still considerably simplify an integrand into something more manageable.</p>
<p>What about definite integrals? We need to be aware of the limits of integration when doing the variable switch:</p>
<p>We are given <span class="math">\(\int_a^b f(x) \frac{\dee}{\dee x} f(x) \dee x\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(u = f(x)\)</span>. We know that <span class="math">\(\dee x = \frac{1}{\frac{\dee u}{\dee x}} \dee u\)</span>.</p>
<p>So <span class="math">\(\int_a^b f(x) \frac{\dee}{\dee x} f(x) \dee x = \int_{u(a)}^{u(b)} u \frac{\dee u}{\dee x} \dee x = \int_{u(a)}^{u(b)} u \frac{\dee u}{\dee x} \frac{1}{\frac{\dee u}{\dee x}} \dee u = \int_{u(a)}^{u(b)} u \dee u = \frac{u^2}{2} + c = \frac{f(x)^2}{2} + c\)</span>.</p>
<p>Basically, if we can find a factor of the integrand <span class="math">\(u\)</span> such that its derivative also appears in the integrand, the method of substition can get rid of the derivative.</p>
<p>Evaluate <span class="math">\(\int \cos x \sin x \dee x\)</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(u = \sin x\)</span>. So <span class="math">\(\dee u = \cos x \dee x\)</span>.<br />So <span class="math">\(\int \cos x \sin x \dee x = \int \sin x \dee u = -\int u \dee u\)</span>.<br />Clearly, <span class="math">\(\int u \dee u = \frac{u^2}{2} + c = \frac{\sin^2 x}{2} + c\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Substitution is useful when we can figure out what a useful substitution would be.</p>
<p>One clue that the substitution is a good choice is if the derivative of the substitution appears in the numerator of the function.</p>
<p>How do we prove that <span class="math">\(\int_1^x \frac{1}{t} = \ln x\)</span>? How do we know that both have the same properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Property 1 - multiplication rule: <span class="math">\(\ln ab = ln a + \ln b\)</span></li>
<li>Property 2 - power rule: <span class="math">\(\ln a^r = r \ln a\)</span>)</li>
</ul>
<p>We want to prove property 1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Select some <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span>.<br />We want to prove that <span class="math">\(\int_1^{ab} \frac{1}{t} \dee t = \int_1^a \frac{1}{t} \dee t + \int_1^b \frac{1}{t} \dee t\)</span>.<br />By linearity of integrals, <span class="math">\(\int_1^{ab} \frac{1}{t} \dee t = \int_1^a \frac{1}{t} \dee t + \int_a^{ab} \frac{1}{t} \dee t\)</span>.<br />Let <span class="math">\(u = \frac{t}{a}\)</span>, so <span class="math">\(t = ua\)</span>. Then <span class="math">\(\dee t = \frac{\dee t}{\dee u} \dee u = a \dee u\)</span>.<br />So <span class="math">\(\int_a^{ab} \frac{1}{t} \dee t = \int_\frac{a}{a}^\frac{ab}{a} \frac{1}{ua} a \dee u = \int_1^b \frac{1}{u} \dee u\)</span>.<br />So <span class="math">\(\int_1^{ab} \frac{1}{t} \dee t = \int_1^a \frac{1}{t} \dee t + \int_a^{ab} \frac{1}{t} \dee t = \int_1^a \frac{1}{t} \dee t + \int_1^b \frac{1}{u} \dee u\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dummy variables can be swapped for any value, even functions like <span class="math">\(f(t)\)</span>.</p>
<h1 id="section-1">8/1/14</h1>
<p>To prove property 2, we need to show that <span class="math">\(\int_1^{a^r} \frac{1}{u} \dee u = r \int_1^a \frac{1}{t} \dee t\)</span>. To do this, we find a substitution that results in the desired limits of integration.</p>
<p>To prove property 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Select some <span class="math">\(u\)</span>.<br />We want to prove that <span class="math">\(\int_1^{a^r} \frac{1}{t} \dee t = r \int_1^a \frac{1}{t} \dee t\)</span>.<br />Let <span class="math">\(u = t^\frac{1}{r}\)</span>, so <span class="math">\(t = u^r\)</span>. Then <span class="math">\(\dee t = \frac{\dee t}{\dee u} \dee u = \frac{\dee}{\dee u} u^r \dee u = ru^{r - 1} \dee u\)</span>.<br />So <span class="math">\(\int_1^{a^r} \frac{1}{t} \dee t = \int_{1^\frac{1}{r}}^{{a^r}^\frac{1}{r}} \frac{1}{u^r} ru^{r - 1} \dee u = \int_1^a \frac{1}{u} r \dee u = r \int_1^a \frac{1}{u} \dee u\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="differentiating-with-respect-to-functions">Differentiating with respect to functions</h3>
<p>As an aside, we can actually differentiate things with respect to functions.</p>
<p>The important property is that <span class="math">\(\frac{\dee x}{\dee b(x)} = \frac{1}{\frac{\dee b(x)}{\dee x}}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Note that <span class="math">\(\frac{\dee a(x)}{\dee b(x)} = \frac{\dee a(x)}{\dee x} \frac{\dee x}{\dee b(x)} = \frac{\dee a(x)}{\dee x} \frac{1}{\frac{\dee b(x)}{\dee x}}\)</span>.</p>
<p>So <span class="math">\(\frac{\dee a(x)}{\dee b(x)} = \frac{\frac{\dee a(x)}{\dee x}}{\frac{\dee b(x)}{\dee x}} = \frac{a&#39;(x)}{b&#39;(x)}\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="integration-by-parts">Integration by Parts</h3>
<p>We often have integrands that are products. For example, <span class="math">\(\int x \sin x \dee x\)</span></p>
<p>It would be nice to be able to differentiate or integrate just one of the factors rather than having to do the whole thing.</p>
<p>Recall the product rule: <span class="math">\(\frac{\dee}{\dee x} (a(x) b(x)) = (\frac{\dee}{\dee x} a(x)) b(x) + a(x) \frac{\dee}{\dee x} b(x)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Move the last term to the left: <span class="math">\((\frac{\dee}{\dee x} a(x)) b(x) = \frac{\dee}{\dee x} (a(x) b(x)) - a(x) \frac{\dee}{\dee x} b(x)\)</span>.</p>
<p>If we integrate both sides with respect to <span class="math">\(x\)</span>, we get: <span class="math">\(\int (\frac{\dee}{\dee x} a(x)) b(x) = \int \frac{\dee}{\dee x} a(x) b(x) - \int a(x) \frac{\dee}{\dee x} b(x)\)</span>.</p>
<p>By FTC2, <span class="math">\(\int (\frac{\dee}{\dee x} a(x)) b(x) = a(x) b(x) + c - \int a(x) \frac{\dee}{\dee x} b(x)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Since there would also be a <span class="math">\(c\)</span> term from the second integral, we don't need to write it. So <span class="math">\(\int (\frac{\dee}{\dee x} a(x)) b(x) \dee x = a(x) b(x) - \int a(x) \frac{\dee}{\dee x} b(x) \dee x\)</span>.</p>
<p>This is the <strong>integration by parts rule</strong>.</p>
<p>Using the same idea, we find that <span class="math">\(\int_a^b (\frac{\dee}{\dee x} a(x)) b(x) = \evalat{a(x) b(x)}_{x = a}^{x = b} - \int_a^b a(x) \frac{\dee}{\dee x} b(x)\)</span>.</p>
<p>When we use the rule, we want to identify two parts of the product such that one of the parts (b) is the factor that becomes <strong>simpler when differentiated</strong>, and the other part (a) is chosen as the <strong>integral of the factor</strong>.</p>
<p>Simplify <span class="math">\(\int x \sin x \dee x\)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="math">\(x\)</span> is much simpler when differentiated. Let <span class="math">\(b(x) = x\)</span>.<br /><span class="math">\(\sin x\)</span> is integrable. Let <span class="math">\(a(x) = \int \sin x = -\cos x\)</span>.<br />So <span class="math">\(\int x \sin x = \int x \frac{\dee}{\dee x} (-\cos x) = -x \cos x - \int (-\cos x) 1 \dee x\)</span>, by integration by parts.<br />So <span class="math">\(-x \cos x - \int (-\cos x) 1 \dee x = -x \cos x + \sin x + c\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can check the answer by differentiating: <span class="math">\(\frac{\dee}{\dee x} (-x \cos x + \sin x + c) = x \sin x\)</span>.</p>
<p>When we use integration by parts, we differentiate one factor, and integrate the other. Then, we can apply the integration by parts formula and obtain a possibly simpler version.</p>
<p>Simplify <span class="math">\(\int_0^1 x e^{-x} \dee x\)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>;wip</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Simplify <span class="math">\(\int_0^1 x^n (\ln x)^n \dee x\)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>;wip</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We often write the integration by parts formula in different forms: <span class="math">\(\int a \dee b = uv - \int v \dee u\)</span>, or <span class="math">\(\int f&#39;(x) g(x) \dee x = f(x) g(x) - \int f(x) g&#39;(x) \dee x\)</span>.</p>
<p>An interesting trick is that we can use integration by parts to integrate anything, since everything is a product of itself and 1.</p>
<p>For example, consider <span class="math">\(\int \arcsin x \dee x\)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clearly, <span class="math">\(\int 1 \cdot \arcsin x \dee x = \int (\frac{\dee}{\dee x} x) \arcsin x \dee x\)</span>.<br />Using integration by parts, with <span class="math">\(a(x) = x, b(x) = \arcsin x\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\int (\frac{\dee}{\dee x} x) \arcsin x \dee x = x \arcsin x - \int \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \dee x\)</span>.<br />We can now use integration by substitution with <span class="math">\(u = 1 - x^2\)</span> to simplify <span class="math">\(\int \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \dee x\)</span>.<br />Clearly, <span class="math">\(\dee x = -\frac{1}{2x} \dee x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \dee x = -\frac{1}{2} \int \frac{1}{\sqrt{u}} \dee u = -\frac{1}{2} \int u^{-\frac{1}{2}} \dee u = -\frac{1}{2} 2 \sqrt{u} + c = -\sqrt{1 - x^2} + c\)</span>.<br />So <span class="math">\(\int \arcsin x \dee x = x \arcsin x - \int \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \dee x = x \arcsin x + \sqrt{1 - x^2} + c\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Simplify <span class="math">\(\int \arccos x \dee x\)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using integration by parts, with <span class="math">\(a(x) = x, b(x) = \arccos x\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\int (\frac{\dee}{\dee x} x) \arccos x \dee x = x \arccos x - \int \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \dee x\)</span>.<br />From the previous question, we know that <span class="math">\(\int \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \dee x = -\sqrt{1 - x^2} + c\)</span>.<br />So <span class="math">\(\int (\frac{\dee}{\dee x} x) \arccos x \dee x = x \arccos x - \int \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \dee x = x \arccos x + \sqrt{1 - x^2} + c\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Simplify <span class="math">\(\int \ln x \dee x\)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using integration by parts, with <span class="math">\(a(x) = x, b(x) = \arccos x\)</span>. <span class="math">\(\int (\frac{\dee}{\dee x} x) \ln x \dee x = x \ln x - \int \frac{x}{x} \dee x = x \ln x - x\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="section-2">10/1/14</h1>
<p>The integration by parts rule is also written as <span class="math">\(\int v \dee u = uv - \int u \dee v\)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clearly, <span class="math">\(\dee a = \frac{\dee a}{\dee x} \dee x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\dee b = \frac{\dee b}{\dee x} \dee x\)</span>.<br />We know that <span class="math">\(\int (\frac{\dee}{\dee x} a(x)) b(x) \dee x = a(x) b(x) - \int a(x) \frac{\dee}{\dee x} b(x) \dee x\)</span> and so <span class="math">\(\int \frac{\dee a}{\dee x} b(x) \dee x = a(x) b(x) - \int a(x) \frac{\dee b}{\dee x} \dee x\)</span>.<br />So <span class="math">\(\int b(x) \dee a = a(x) b(x) - \int a(x) \dee b\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>;wip: work on assignment 1 in math138 and 136</p>
<p>We can also write it as <span class="math">\(\int f(x) g(x) \dee x = \int f(x) \dee x g(x) - \int \int f(x) \dee x \frac{\dee g}{\dee x} \dee x\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="getting-back-what-we-started-with">Getting Back What We Started With</h3>
<p>Consider <span class="math">\(I = \int e^{-x} \sin x\)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We choose <span class="math">\(\frac{\dee}{\dee x} e^{-x} = -e^{-x}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\int \sin x \dee x = -\cos x\)</span>.<br />So <span class="math">\(I = \int e^{-x} \frac{\dee}{\dee x} (-\cos x) \dee x = e^{-x} (-\cos x) - \int e^{-x} \cos x\)</span>.<br />We choose <span class="math">\(\frac{\dee}{\dee x} (-e^{-x}) = e^{-x}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\int \cos x \dee x = \sin x\)</span>.<br />Clearly, <span class="math">\(\int e^{-x} \cos x = \int e^{-x} \frac{\dee}{\dee x} \sin x = e^{-x} \sin x - \int (-e^{-x}) \sin x = e^{-x} \sin x + I\)</span>.<br />So <span class="math">\(I = -e^{-x} \cos x - \int e^{-x} \cos x = -e^{-x} \cos x - e^{-x} \sin x - I\)</span>.<br />So <span class="math">\(2I = -e^{-x} (\cos x + \sin x)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(I = -\frac{1}{2}e^{-x} (\cos x + \sin x)\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, we used integration by parts to rewrite the expression, then used integration by parts again to simplify the remaining integral. In doing so we obtained a result that contained the original expression, which we substituted and solved algebraically.</p>
<p>This technique is only really useful for problems of the form <span class="math">\(\int e^{ax} \sin bx \dee x\)</span> or <span class="math">\(\int e^{ax} \cos bx \dee x\)</span>.</p>
<p>Simplify <span class="math">\(\int_0^1 (-\ln x)^n \dee x, n \in \mb{N}\)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We will try it for the first few values of <span class="math">\(n\)</span>.<br />For <span class="math">\(n = 1\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\int_0^1 (-\ln x)^n \dee x = -\int_0^1 1 \ln x \dee x = -\int_0^1 \ln x \frac{\dee}{\dee x} x = -\evalat{x \ln x}_0^1 + \int_0^1 x \frac{1}{x} = -1 \ln 1 + 0 \ln 0 + 1\)</span> (indeterminate form <span class="math">\(0 \cdot -\infty\)</span>).<br />This is a thing known as an improper integral (covered later in the course).<br />We can solve it because what we really want is <span class="math">\(\lim_{x \to 0} x \ln x = \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\ln x}{\frac{1}{x}} \lH \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\frac{1}{x}}{-\frac{1}{x^2}} = \lim_{x \to 0} (-x) = 0\)</span> rather than the value <span class="math">\(0 \ln 0\)</span>.<br />So <span class="math">\(-\int_0^1 \ln x \dee x = -1 \ln 1 + 0 + 1 = 1\)</span>.<br />If we repeat this for <span class="math">\(n = 2, 3, \ldots\)</span>, we find that <span class="math">\(\int_0^1 (-\ln x)^n \dee x = n!, n \in \mb{N}\)</span>, yet it also works for fractional values of <span class="math">\(n\)</span> - this is the generalized factorial over positive real numbers!<br />;wip: use induction</p>

<h1 id="section-3">13/1/14</h1>
<h2 id="trigonometric-substitution">Trigonometric Substitution</h2>
<p>This is integration by substitution with the substitution using trignonometric functions.</p>
<p>We use trigonometric functions in our substitutions and use trigonometric identities to simplify the integrand.</p>
<p>We will need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pythagorean theorem: <span class="math">\(\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1\)</span></li>
<li>Half angle cosine formula: <span class="math">\(\cos^2 \theta = \frac{1}{2}(1 + \cos 2\theta)\)</span></li>
<li>Half angle sine formula: <span class="math">\(\sin^2 \theta = \frac{1}{2}(1 - \cos 2\theta)\)</span></li>
<li>Pythagorean theorem divided by <span class="math">\(\cos^2 \theta\)</span>: <span class="math">\(1 + \tan^2 \theta = \sec^2 \theta\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>We usually need this method when we have a square root of a quadratic expression.</p>
<p>Common substitutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <span class="math">\(1 - \sin^2 = \cos^2 \theta\)</span> to turn <span class="math">\(\sqrt{1 - x^2}\)</span> into <span class="math">\(\cos \theta\)</span> via <span class="math">\(x = \sin \theta\)</span>.</li>
<li>Use <span class="math">\(1 + \tan^2 \theta = \sec^2 \theta\)</span> to turn <span class="math">\(\sqrt{1 + x^2}\)</span> into <span class="math">\(\sec \theta\)</span> via <span class="math">\(x = \tan \theta\)</span>.</li>
<li>Use <span class="math">\(\sec^2 \theta - 1 = \tan^2 \theta\)</span> to turn <span class="math">\(\sqrt{x^2 - 1}\)</span> into <span class="math">\(\tan \theta\)</span> via <span class="math">\(x = \sec \theta\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using this technique, we can replace <span class="math">\(\sqrt{\pm a^2 \pm x^2}\)</span> with trigonometric functions, and then use trigonometric identities on them. Afterwards, we might simplify by changing the trigonometric functions back into square roots.</p>
<p>Derivatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(\cos&#39; \theta = -\sin \theta\)</span> (<span class="math">\(-\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta &lt; \frac{\pi}{2}\)</span>)</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\sin&#39; \theta = \cos \theta\)</span> (<span class="math">\(-\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta &lt; \frac{\pi}{2}\)</span>)</li>

<h2 id="volumes-of-solids">Volumes of Solids</h2>

<p>In general, the volume of an arbitrary solid requires a multi-variable/multi-dimensional integral (a calculus III topic). However, there are cases where symmetry allows us to use a single variable integral.</p>

<p>Find the volume of a square prism with dimensions <span class="math">\(b \times b \times h\)</span>:</p>

<p>The area of the base slice stays the same as we go along the z-axis - as we vary <span class="math">\(h\)</span>, the slice is still <span class="math">\(b \times b\)</span>.<br />So the volume is <span class="math">\(\int_0^h b^2 \dee x = b^2 \int_0^h 1 \dee x = b^2 h\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The basic idea is that we take the solid, slice the shape along one axis, then integrate the area as a function of the extent along the axis that we sliced along. This works because of the symmetry of some shapes that allows us to avoid considering some dimensions.</p>
<p><span class="math">\(V = \int_a^b A(x) \dee x\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(V\)</span> is the volume, <span class="math">\(A(x)\)</span> is the area of a slice at extent <span class="math">\(x\)</span> (though other axes can be used too depending on the problem), and <span class="math">\(\dee x\)</span> is the width of the slice.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>We can generalize this to any function rotated about a line. The resulting solids are called <strong>solids of rotation</strong>.</p>
<p>The reason this works is because the z-axis is basically redundant information that is already expressed in the y-axis.</p>
<p>Find the volume of the solid represented by rotating <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span> about the x-axis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The area of each slice at each extent along the x-axis is the area of a circle with the radius <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span>.<br />The area function is <span class="math">\(A(x) = \pi f(x)^2\)</span>.<br />So the volume is <span class="math">\(\int_a^b A(x) \dee x = \pi \int_a^b f(x)^2 \dee x\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="section-7">22/1/14</h1>
<p>;wip: figure out how to find the length of a curve in 2D</p>
<p>The rotation method works whenever we can find the area function for a given slice along a certain axis.</p>
<p>Here, <span class="math">\(\delta V = A(x) \delta x\)</span>, and then we add up all these tiny volumes to get the total volume.</p>
<p>This method is called the <strong>method of disks</strong>, because we are integrating the volume of a lot of small disks along the axis of rotation.</p>
<p>There is another way to approximate the area and have it converge into an exact value. We can estimate the volume of solids of rotation by integrating the volume of a lot of nested cylinders perpendicular to the axis of rotation - this is the <strong>method of shells</strong>.</p>
<p>Consider a hollow cylinder of thickness <span class="math">\(\dee x\)</span> with inner radius <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and height <span class="math">\(h(x)\)</span>. If we cut it and unroll it, then it becomes very close to a cuboid of dimensions <span class="math">\(2\pi x\)</span> by <span class="math">\(h(x)\)</span> by <span class="math">\(\dee x\)</span>. In other words, we assume the inner circumference is almost the same as the outer circumference, since <span class="math">\(\dee x\)</span> is so small.</p>
<p>So the enclosed volume of the cylinder is <span class="math">\(2\pi x h(x) \dee x\)</span>.</p>
<p>How do we use these shells to find the volume of a solid? If we look at the cross section of our shape, we can approximate the area of this cross section using rectangles that have a fixed width <span class="math">\(\dee x\)</span> perpendicular to the axis of rotation, and length <span class="math">\(h(x)\)</span> along the axis of rotation.</p>
<p>Then the volume of the solid is the sum of the volume of all the nested cylinders: <span class="math">\(\int_a^b 2 \pi x h(x) \dee x\)</span>.</p>
<p>Consider a cone extending along the x-axis represented by the equation <span class="math">\(y = 1 - x\)</span> from 0 to 1 rotated about the x-axis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We want the height of the cylinder at each point along the y-axis, an axis perpendicular to the axis of rotation.<br />The height is <span class="math">\(x = 1 - y\)</span>. So the volume of the shell at any extent along the radius is <span class="math">\(2 \pi y(1 - y) \dee x\)</span>.<br />So the volume is <span class="math">\(\int_0^1 2 \pi y(1 - y) \dee y\)</span>. Note that we only integrate from the axis of rotation to the radius, not the diameter, because the cylinders go around over to the other side.<br />So the volume is <span class="math">\(\frac{\pi}{3}\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finding the height of the shell is not always the same as finding the inverse. Consider the bowl-like shape formed by rotating <span class="math">\(y = \sqrt{x}\)</span> from 0 to 0 about the y-axis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We want the height of the bowl at each point along the x-axis, an axis perpendicular to the axis of rotation.<br />The height is <span class="math">\(y = 1 - x^2\)</span>, since the height of each cylinder is decreasing as we move outwards.<br />So the volume is <span class="math">\(\int_0^1 2 \pi x(1 - x^2) \dee x = \frac{\pi}{2}\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that this is the same as if we used <span class="math">\(x = y^2\)</span> (the inverse of the function). There are two possibilities for the cylinder height: either the inverse of the function, if the shape gets thinner as we move along the axis of rotation, or the maximum height minus the inverse, if the shape gets thicker as we move along the axis of rotation. Here, since the <span class="math">\(\sqrt{x}\)</span> shape gets thicker, we used <span class="math">\(1 - x^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>The method of shells works best when we know the height from the axis perpendicular to the axis of rotation, and the method of disks works when we can find the area of each slice along the axis of rotation.</p>
<h1 id="section-8">24/1/14</h1>
<p>The method of shells and the method of disks both have cases where they work better than the other. The method of disks works best for functions that extend parallel to the axis of rotation, while the method of shells, for functions that extend perpendicular to the axis of rotation.</p>
<p>The method of disks uses the formula <span class="math">\(\int_a^b A(x) \dee x\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(a, b\)</span> are the extents along the axis of rotation.</p>
<p>The method of shells uses the formula <span class="math">\(\int_0^b h(x) 2\pi x \dee x\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(b\)</span> is the extent perpendicular to the axis of rotation.</p>
<p>Consider <span class="math">\(y = 2x^2 - x^3 = x^2(2 - x)\)</span> from 0 to 2 rotated about the y-axis:</p>

<p>This solid looks like the top half of a donut.<br />The method of disks is difficult to use here, because we would need disks with holes in them. We will use the method of shells.<br />The height of each of our cylinders is <span class="math">\(h(x) = 2x^2 - x^3\)</span>.<br />The volume of each shell is <span class="math">\(\delta V = h(x) 2\pi x \dee x = 4\pi x^3 \dee x - 2\pi x^4 \dee x\)</span>.<br />So the volume of the solid is <span class="math">\(4\pi \int_0^2 x^3 \dee x - 2\pi \int_0^2 x^4 \dee x = 4\pi \evalat{\frac{x^4}{4}}_0^2 - 2\pi \evalat{\frac{x^5}{5}}_0^2 = 4\pi \frac{2^4}{4} - 2\pi \frac{2^5}{5} = \frac{16\pi}{5}\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A variation on the method is disks is the <strong>method of washers</strong>. Here, we have disks with holes in them for whatever reason, and our area, rather than simply being the area of a circle, is the area of the circle minus the area of the hole in the middle. Make sure to use <span class="math">\(\pi \int (r_o^2 - r_i^2) \dee x\)</span> rather than <span class="math">\(\pi \int (r_o - r_i)^2 \dee x\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(r_o\)</span> is the outer radius and <span class="math">\(r_i\)</span> is the inner radius.</p>
<p>For example, what is the volume enclosed by rotating the area between <span class="math">\(y = \sqrt{x}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y = x\)</span> about the x-axis? We could use the disk method, except instead of finding the area of a disk, we find the area of a disk with a hole in it, a washer. However, in this case it would be easier to do it with the method of shells.</p>

<h2 id="improper-integrals">Improper Integrals</h2>
<p>An integral is improper if some part of it goes to <span class="math">\(\pm \infty\)</span> - either the integrand or the domain of integration (limits of integration).</p>
<p>The way we deal with this is to take limits of the infinite values instead of using these infinite values.</p>
<p>Improper integrals work when the domain is infinite (<span class="math">\(\int_0^\infty f(x) \dee x\)</span>), when the integrand is infinite at one of the endpoints (<span class="math">\(\int_0^1 \frac{1}{x}\)</span>), or when the integrand is infinite within the domain (<span class="math">\(\int_{-1}^1 \frac{1}{x} \dee x\)</span>)</p>
<p>For example, <span class="math">\(\int_a^\infty f(x) \dee x = \lim_{T \to \infty} \int_a^T f(x) \dee x\)</span>.</p>
<p>For example, <span class="math">\(\int_0^\infty e^{-x} \dee x = \lim_{T \to \infty} \int_0^T e^{-x} \dee x = \lim_{T \to \infty} \evalat{-e^{-x}}_0^T = \lim_{T \to \infty} (-e^{-T}) - (-e^{-0}) = 0 + 1 = 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Prove that the volume obtained by rotating <span class="math">\(y = \frac{1}{x}\)</span> about the x-axis for <span class="math">\(x \in [1, \infty)\)</span> is finite:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The volume is <span class="math">\(\int_1^\infty \pi \frac{1}{x^2} \dee x = \pi \lim_{T \to \infty} \evalat{-\frac{1}{x}}_1^T = \pi\)</span>, found via the method of disks. Clearly, the volume is finite.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes, the integrand itself will diverge. Consider <span class="math">\(\int_0^1 \ln x \dee x\)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="math">\(\ln 0 = -\infty\)</span>, and we cannot evaluate the antiderivative at this point.<br />Instead, we write it as <span class="math">\(\lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \int_\epsilon^1 \ln x \dee x = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \evalat{x \ln x - x}_\epsilon^1 = 0 - 1 - (\lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \epsilon \ln \epsilon - \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \epsilon) = 0 - 1 - (0 - 0) = -1\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, the integrand might diverge somewhere within the domain of integration. This is not always immediately obvious and must always be considered when doing integrals.</p>
<p>Consider <span class="math">\(\int_{-1}^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{\abs{x}}} \dee x\)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a vertical asymptote at <span class="math">\(x = 0\)</span>. This makes it so that we can't directly use the fundemental theorem of calculus to evaluate the integral.<br />We can instead split the integral at the middle, and since it is an even function, we can combine the two integrals: <span class="math">\(2\int_0^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \dee x\)</span>.<br />There is an asymptote, so the integral is an improper one: <span class="math">\(2\int_0^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \dee x = 2 \lim_{T \to 0} \int_T^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \dee x = 2 (2 \cdot 1^\frac{1}{2} - 2\lim_{T \to 0} T^\frac{1}{2}) = 4\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consider <span class="math">\(\int_{-1}^1 \dee x\)</span>: ;wip: what was the question?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We might do <span class="math">\(\int_{-1}^1 \dee x = \evalat{-\sqrt{x}}_{-1}^1 = -2\)</span>.<br />However, the integral <strong>does not exist</strong>. We need to be careful because the result looks just fine, and does not indicate that an error occurred.<br />The integral does not make any sense because the integrand diverges towards <span class="math">\(\infty\)</span> at <span class="math">\(x = 0\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea behind this is that we need to figure out if an improper integral exists even without integrating it first.</p>
<p>If a function <strong>converges</strong>, that means it goes to a finite value. The opposite is if it <strong>diverges</strong>, when it goes to <span class="math">\(\pm \infty\)</span> or does not exist.</p>
<p>In other words, convergence means the result is a number, and divergence means the result is not a number.</p>

<h2 id="applications-of-integration">Applications of Integration</h2>
<p>Many physical phenomena can be represented by <strong>differential equations</strong> - equations that include derivatives.</p>
<p>This comes about usually through empirical evidence/oberservation, and some by conservation principles.</p>
<h3 id="cooling">Cooling</h3>
<p>For example, Newton's Law of Cooling was discovered by Newton's measurements of hot materials in cooler surroundings.</p>
<p>The law states that the change in temperature is linearly propertional to the temperature difference with the surroundings.</p>
<p>In other words, <span class="math">\(\frac{\dee}{\dee x} T_h = -k(T_h - T_r)\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(T_h\)</span> is the temperature of the hot thing, <span class="math">\(T_r\)</span> is the surrounding temperature, and <span class="math">\(k\)</span> is the cooling coefficient.</p>
<p>Note that <span class="math">\(k\)</span> is non-negative and we use <span class="math">\(-k\)</span> because hot things cool. This cooling coefficient is influenced by the material and shape of the object.</p>
<p>From this we can tell that the object stops cooling when <span class="math">\(T_h = T_r\)</span>, so <span class="math">\(\frac{\dee}{\dee x} T_h = 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Values of <span class="math">\(T\)</span> for which <span class="math">\(\frac{\dee T_h}{\dee x} = 0\)</span> are called <strong>equilibria</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="conservation">Conservation</h3>
<p>Most differential equations in science and engineering come from <strong>conservation principles</strong> - principles that apply universally and constrain what can happen. For example, conservation of mass/energy/charge/momentum.</p>
<p>Conservation principles are easy to represent in mathematics, though the models can be pretty elaborate. Basically, what they state is that the rate of the change of something is the rate of change of something increasing minus the rate of stuff decreasing.</p>
<p>For example, the rate of change of people of the people in the room is the rate of change of people entering minus the rate of change of people leaving.</p>
<p>The rate of something increasing is called a <strong>source</strong>. The rate of something decreasing is called a <strong>sink</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, consider a skydiver immediately after their parachute opens:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clearly, <span class="math">\(m\frac{\dee \vec{v}}{\dee x} = \sum \vec{F} = m \vec{g} - \vec{F}_d\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(\vec{F}_d\)</span> is the drag force.<br />We can calculate the drag force in a lab independent of everything else, and not have to worry about the other things like the height or gravity.<br />Typically, <span class="math">\(\vec{F}_d = k\vec{v}\)</span> for some constant <span class="math">\(k\)</span>.<br />So <span class="math">\(\frac{\dee \vec{v}}{\dee x} = \vec{g} - \frac{k}{m} \vec{v}\)</span>.</p>

<p>A tank holds 80L of water at time <span class="math">\(t = 0\)</span>. A salt solution of 0.25 kg/L flows into the tank at 8L/min. Liquid drains at a rate of 12L/min from the tank.

<p>We assume the salt solution instantly mixes with the water.<br />We want to find <span class="math">\(\frac{\dee}{\dee t} x(t)\)</span>, which is <span class="math">\(\text{source} - \text{sink}\)</span>.<br />The source is <span class="math">\(\text{salt concentration} \cdot {inflow rate} = 0.25 \text{kg/L} \cdot 8 \text{L/min} = 2 \text{kg/min}\)</span>.<br />Clearly, <span class="math">\(\frac{\dee}{\dee x} \text{liquid level} = \text{inflow rate} - \text{outflow rate} = 8 \text{L/min} - 12 \text{L/min} = -4 \text{L/min}\)</span>.<br />So the liquid level is <span class="math">\(80 + \int \frac{\dee}{\dee x} \text{liquid level} \dee t = 80 - 4t\)</span>.<br />Clearly, <span class="math">\(\text{salt concentration} = \frac{\text{mass of salt}}{\text{volume of tank}} = \frac{x(t)}{80 - 4t}\)</span>.<br />The sink is <span class="math">\(\text{salt concentration} \cdot \text{outflow rate} = \frac{x(t)}{80 - 4t} \cdot 12 \text{kg/L} = \frac{3x(t)}{20 - t}\)</span>.<br />So <span class="math">\(\frac{\dee}{\dee x} x(t) = 2 - \frac{3x(t)}{20 - t}\)</span>.<br />Note that the tank is empty when <span class="math">\(t = 20\)</span>, when the outflow rate is undefined.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many things we can say about the function even without solving it. These are called <strong>qualitiative analyses</strong>.</p>
<p>Suppose we have <span class="math">\(\frac{\dee y}{\dee x} = f(x, y)\)</span>. Note that the left side is equal to the slope of the tangent line, and the right side is an expression for the slope of the tangent line for any point <span class="math">\((x, y)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Basically, every point on the Cartesian plane now has an associated slope, and we can represent this roughly with arrows on the graph representing the trend in the slopes.</p>
<p>These arrows/contours are called streamlines.</p>
<p>Think of this as a stream with currents and eddies. Every possible solution is a possible path a floating object will take if dropped at a particular place in the stream and allowed to bob along with the stream. The solutions are we get if we start at a possible point and draw a curve that has the slope of the tangent always equal to the value at the flow field at the point under the curve.</p>
<p>We can also think of them as a topographical map of some terrain. If we drop a ball along a point on the map, it will trace out a certain line. If we drop it slightly off to one side, it may take a different path, which could be similar, or completely different. The slope of the tangent represents the slope of the hill at a particular point.</p>
<p>The set of all possible solutions is therefore a family of functions that look like a map of water currents.</p>
<p>An <strong>equilibrium</strong> is a place where <span class="math">\(\frac{\dee y}{\dee x} = f(x) = 0\)</span>. Because the slope of the tangent is 0, it must be 0 for all <span class="math">\(x\)</span> values. There are <strong>stable</strong> and <strong>unstable</strong> equilibria.</p>
<p>Stable equilibria are those where values that are close to them get closer to them, like dropping a ball on the side of a valley and having it eventually roll to the bottom of the valley.</p>
<p>Unstable equilibria are those where values that are close to them get farther away from them, like dropping a ball at the peak of a mountain and having it roll away from the peak. Only values that are exactly on the unstable equilibrium will stay there.</p>
<p>Consider <span class="math">\(\frac{\dee y}{\dee x} = 1 - y^2\)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The slope of the tangent line is <span class="math">\(\begin{cases} \text{negative} &amp;\text{if } y &lt; -1 \\ \text{positive} &amp;\text{if } -1 &lt; y &lt; 1 \\ \text{negative} &amp;\text{if } y &gt; 1 \end{cases}\)</span>.<br />We can visualize this as a flow field with three distinct sections.<br />Note that if we start at <span class="math">\(y = -1, 1\)</span>, we stay at that same value regardless of the value of <span class="math">\(x\)</span>. This is called an equilibrium, since the value isn't changing.<br />Note that if we start at any <span class="math">\(y &gt; -1\)</span>, <span class="math">\(y \to 1\)</span> as <span class="math">\(x \to \infty\)</span> (convergent), and if we start at any <span class="math">\(y &lt; -1\)</span>, <span class="math">\(y \to -\infty\)</span> as <span class="math">\(x \to \infty\)</span> (divergent).</p>

<p>Differential equations of the form <span class="math">\(\frac{\dee y}{\dee x} = f(y)\)</span> are called autonomous differential equations. Note that they do not depend on the value of <span class="math">\(x\)</span>.</p>
<p>The equilibria of an autonomous differential equation are those <span class="math">\(y\)</span> values for which <span class="math">\(\frac{\dee y}{\dee x} = g(y) = 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>An equilibrium <span class="math">\(y = k\)</span> is stable if and only if <span class="math">\(f&#39;(k) &lt; 0\)</span> - if the change in the slope at the location is negative. Otherwise, it is unstable.</p>
<h2 id="solving-differential-equations">Solving Differential Equations</h2>
<p>Consider <span class="math">\(\frac{\dee y}{\dee x} = y - x\)</span>, with <span class="math">\(y(0) = 2\)</span>.</p>
<p>This is a differential equation of the form <span class="math">\(\frac{\dee y}{\dee x} = f(x, y)\)</span></p>
<p>We can use the differential equation to estimate a certain solution, much like a Riemann sum.</p>
<p>First, we pick a starting point so we have a single solution to the differential equation, a member of the family of solutions. This is a curve on the Cartesian plane.</p>
<p>This starting point is called the <strong>initial condition</strong>. The initial condition often takes the form of <span class="math">\(y(x) = y(0) = 2\)</span> - the <span class="math">\(y\)</span>-value at <span class="math">\(x = 0\)</span> is 2 for this solution.</p>
<p>First, we break up the domain into pieces, by choosing value for <span class="math">\(x_1, \ldots, x_n\)</span>.</p>
<p>Then, we use <span class="math">\(\frac{\dee y}{\dee x} = f(x, y)\)</span> to estimate the slope of the tangent at any given <span class="math">\(x\)</span> value.</p>
<p>Then, we observe that <span class="math">\(\frac{\dee y}{\dee x} = f(x_{n - 1}, y_{n - 1}) \approx \frac{y_n - y_{n - 1}}{x_n - x_{n - 1}}\)</span> - the slope of the tangent is close to the slope of the secant.</p>
<p>So <span class="math">\(y_n(x) \approx y_{n - 1} + (x_n - x_{n - 1})f(x_{n - 1}, y_{n - 1})\)</span>. This is written in update form, so we can now use a table of values to calculate it.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(\delta x = x_n - x_{n - 1}\)</span>. Then <span class="math">\(y_n(x) \approx y_{n - 1} + f(x_{n - 1}, y_{n - 1}) \delta x\)</span>.</p>
<p>We can also write this as <span class="math">\(y_{n + 1}(x) \approx y_n + f(x_n, y_n) \delta x\)</span> where <span class="math">\(\delta x = x_{n + 1} - x_n\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now we can write <span class="math">\(\frac{\dee y}{\dee x} = y - x\)</span> as <span class="math">\(y_n(x) \approx y_{n - 1} + (x_n - x_{n - 1})(x_{n - 1} - y_{n - 1})\)</span>.</p>
<p>We can actually approximate this function by using a table of values. Since <span class="math">\(y(0) = 2\)</span>, <span class="math">\(y_0 = 2\)</span>:</p>

<p>Now we can a table of values for the equation. We can plot this on a graph to approximate the curve.</p>
<p>The actual solution can also be found, though not through these techniques. The general solution is <span class="math">\(y = 1 + x + c^x, c \in \mb{R}\)</span>.</p>
<p>This is called <strong>Euler's method</strong>. It is a method for numerically solving differential equations.</p>
<h3 id="integration">Integration</h3>
<p>If we want exact solutions, we have to integrate. This is not always possible, but is in certain cases.</p>
<p><strong>Separable equations</strong> are one variety of them. They are equations of the form <span class="math">\(\frac{\dee y}{\dee x} = A(x) B(y)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Note that <span class="math">\(y\)</span> is also a function of <span class="math">\(x\)</span>, so <span class="math">\(B(y)\)</span> is another function of <span class="math">\(x\)</span>. We write <span class="math">\(y = y(x)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Clearly, <span class="math">\(\frac{\dee y}{\dee x} = A(x) B(y)\)</span> is the same as <span class="math">\(\frac{1}{B(y)} \frac{\dee y}{\dee x} = A(x)\)</span>.</p>
<p>If we integrate both sides, we get <span class="math">\(\int \frac{1}{B(y)} \frac{\dee y}{\dee x} \dee x = \int A(x) \dee x\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now we can &quot;cancel <span class="math">\(\dee x\)</span>&quot;. Let <span class="math">\(u = y(x)\)</span>.

This is basically the definition of the substitution rule for integrals.</p>
<p>So <span class="math">\(\int \frac{1}{B(y)} \frac{\dee y}{\dee x} \dee x = \int \frac{1}{B(u)} \frac{\dee y}{\dee x} \frac{1}{\frac{\dee y}{\dee x}} \dee u = \int \frac{1}{B(u)} \dee u = \int \frac{1}{B(y)} \dee y\)</span>.</p>
<p>So <span class="math">\(\int \frac{1}{B(y)} \dee y = \int A(x) \dee x\)</span>.</p>
<p>We can also think of this as multiplying both sides of <span class="math">\(\frac{1}{B(y)} \frac{\dee y}{\dee x} = A(x)\)</span> by <span class="math">\(\dee x\)</span> and integrating both sides.</p>

<p>First we rearrange until there is only one variable on each side, then we integrate, and finally, fix the constant of integration <span class="math">\(c\)</span> by solving for it with the given values for the axis variables.</p>

<p>Suppose we have a population of <span class="math">\(n\)</span> individuals. The simplest population model is <span class="math">\(\frac{\dee n}{\dee t} = kn\)</span> for some <span class="math">\(k \ge 0\)</span>. Solve for <span class="math">\(n\)</span>:</p>

A = e^c; n &amp;= Ae^{kt} \\

\]</span> Note that at <span class="math">\(t = 0\)</span>, <span class="math">\(n = n_0\)</span> for some constant <span class="math">\(n_0\)</span> - the starting population.<br />So <span class="math">\(n_0 = Ae^{k0}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(A = n_0\)</span>.<br />So <span class="math">\(n = n_0e^{kt}\)</span>.</p>

<p>A simple variation on this population growth model is <strong>logistic growth</strong>, which also models resource exhaustion: <span class="math">\(\frac{\dee N}{\dee t} = rN\left(1 - \frac{N}{k}\right)\)</span>. Note that there are two equalibria - <span class="math">\(N = 0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(N = k\)</span>. <span class="math">\(k\)</span> is a constant called the <strong>carrying capacity</strong>.</p>
<p>For <span class="math">\(\frac{n}{k} \ll 1\)</span> (much less than), logistic growth behaves like exponential growth.</p>
<p>The flow field looks like arrows pointing right toward <span class="math">\(N(t) = k\)</span>. Therefore, the population always tends toward <span class="math">\(k\)</span> in this model.</p>
<h1 id="section-14">7/2/14</h1>
<p>The main idea is that there is a lot more to the equations than just the solutions. The flow field is useful for discovering how the equation behaves.</p>
<p>Even when we solve the equation, it does not tell us much about how the function works intuitively.</p>
<p>Solve <span class="math">\(\frac{\dee N}{\dee t} = rN\left(1 - \frac{N}{k}\right)\)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
\frac{\dee N}{\dee t} &amp;= rN\left(1 - \frac{N}{k}\right) \\
\int \frac{1}{N\left(1 - \frac{N}{k}\right)} \frac{\dee N}{\dee t} \dee t &amp;= \int r \dee t \\
\int \frac{1}{N\left(1 - \frac{N}{k}\right)} \dee N &amp;= rt + c \\
\int \frac{A}{N} + \frac{B}{1 - \frac{N}{k}} \dee N &amp;= rt + c \\
A\left(1 - \frac{N}{k}\right) + BN &amp;= 1; A = 1; B = \frac{1}{k} \\
\int \frac{1}{N} + \frac{\frac{1}{k}}{1 - \frac{N}{k}} \dee N &amp;= rt + c \\
\ln \abs{N} + \int \frac{1}{k - N} \dee N &amp;= rt + c \\
\ln \abs{N} - \ln \abs{N - k} &amp;= rt + c \\
\ln \abs{\frac{N}{N - k}} &amp;= rt + c \\
-\ln \abs{\frac{N}{N - k}} &amp;= -rt - c \\

\]</span> Note that all solutions tend toward <span class="math">\(k\)</span>, which we can verify by taking the limit of <span class="math">\(N\)</span> at infinity.<br />Now we will solve for <span class="math">\(F\)</span> - at <span class="math">\(t = 0\)</span>, <span class="math">\(N = N_0\)</span>.
