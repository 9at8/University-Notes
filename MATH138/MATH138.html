<p>Assignments are due every Friday at 3:30pm. They are posted on LEARN.</p>
<p>My own drop box is box 5, slot 12</p>
<p>Midterm is Feb. 24, 7-9pm.</p>
<p>Lecture notes are on the <a href="http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~mscott/euler.htm">course website</a>, posted every week. The password to the website is &quot;euler&quot;. ;wip: get these every week</p>
<p>Course outline:</p>
<ul>
<li>Techniques of integration and applications.</li>
<li>Extensions of single variable calculus - differential equations, vector calculus, etc.</li>
<li>Taylor polynomials</li>
</ul>
<p>Sequence: <span class="math">\(1, 2, 3, \ldots\)</span> Series: <span class="math">\(1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots\)</span></p>
<p>Taylor polynomials are series of functions, which allow us to represent almost any function as a polynomial. This is the most powerful technique in applied mathematics - science and mathematics.</p>
<p>By the way, <span class="math">\(\dee x\)</span> is called an <strong>infinitesmal</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="techniques-of-integration">Techniques of Integration</h2>
<p>Techniques of integration rewrite functions in forms that we can't integrate into forms that we can integrate, or simpler forms that we might be able to apply other techniques on.</p>
<h3 id="method-of-substitution">Method of substitution</h3>
<p>The method of substitution is based on choosing a subexpression <span class="math">\(u\)</span>, and then integrating with respect to it. If <span class="math">\(u\)</span> is chosen carefully, it is occasionally possible to simplify the integral.</p>
<p>This method works best when a <strong>function and its derivative appear in the integrand</strong>.</p>
<p>This works with expressions of the form <span class="math">\(\int f(x) \frac{\dee}{\dee x} f(x) \dee x\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(u = f(x)\)</span>. Since <span class="math">\(\frac{\dee u}{\dee x} = \frac{\dee u}{\dee x}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\dee u = \frac{\dee u}{\dee x} \dee x\)</span> (multiply both sides by <span class="math">\(\dee x\)</span>). This is possible because of infinismals, which work in wierd and wonderful ways. So <span class="math">\(\dee x = \frac{1}{\frac{\dee u}{\dee x}} \dee u\)</span>.</p>
<p>So <span class="math">\(\int f(x) \frac{\dee}{\dee x} f(x) \dee x = \int u \frac{\dee u}{\dee x} \dee x = \int u \frac{\dee u}{\dee x} \frac{1}{\frac{\dee u}{\dee x}} \dee u = \int u \dee u = \frac{u^2}{2} + c = \frac{f(x)^2}{2} + c\)</span>.</p>
<p>Even if we can't simplify it far enough to get an antiderivative, integration by substitution can still considerably simplify an integrand into something more manageable.</p>
<p>What about definite integrals? We need to be aware of the limits of integration when doing the variable switch:</p>
<p>We are given <span class="math">\(\int_a^b f(x) \frac{\dee}{\dee x} f(x) \dee x\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(u = f(x)\)</span>. We know that <span class="math">\(\dee x = \frac{1}{\frac{\dee u}{\dee x}} \dee u\)</span>.</p>
<p>So <span class="math">\(\int_a^b f(x) \frac{\dee}{\dee x} f(x) \dee x = \int_{u(a)}^{u(b)} u \frac{\dee u}{\dee x} \dee x = \int_{u(a)}^{u(b)} u \frac{\dee u}{\dee x} \frac{1}{\frac{\dee u}{\dee x}} \dee u = \int_{u(a)}^{u(b)} u \dee u = \frac{u^2}{2} + c = \frac{f(x)^2}{2} + c\)</span>.</p>
<p>Basically, if we can find a factor of the integrand <span class="math">\(u\)</span> such that its derivative also appears in the integrand, the method of substition can get rid of the derivative.</p>
<p>Evaluate <span class="math">\(\int \cos x \sin x \dee x\)</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(u = \sin x\)</span>. So <span class="math">\(\dee u = \cos x \dee x\)</span>.<br />So <span class="math">\(\int \cos x \sin x \dee x = \int \sin x \dee u = -\int u \dee u\)</span>.<br />Clearly, <span class="math">\(\int u \dee u = \frac{u^2}{2} + c = \frac{\sin^2 x}{2} + c\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Substitution is useful when we can figure out what a useful substitution would be.</p>
<p>One clue that the substitution is a good choice is if the derivative of the substitution appears in the numerator of the function.</p>
<p>How do we prove that <span class="math">\(\int_1^x \frac{1}{t} = \ln x\)</span>? How do we know that both have the same properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Property 1 - multiplication rule: <span class="math">\(\ln ab = ln a + \ln b\)</span></li>
<li>Property 2 - power rule: <span class="math">\(\ln a^r = r \ln a\)</span>)</li>
</ul>
<p>We want to prove property 1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Select some <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span>.<br />We want to prove that <span class="math">\(\int_1^{ab} \frac{1}{t} \dee t = \int_1^a \frac{1}{t} \dee t + \int_1^b \frac{1}{t} \dee t\)</span>.<br />By linearity of integrals, <span class="math">\(\int_1^{ab} \frac{1}{t} \dee t = \int_1^a \frac{1}{t} \dee t + \int_a^{ab} \frac{1}{t} \dee t\)</span>.<br />Let <span class="math">\(u = \frac{t}{a}\)</span>, so <span class="math">\(t = ua\)</span>. Then <span class="math">\(\dee t = \frac{\dee t}{\dee u} \dee u = a \dee u\)</span>.<br />So <span class="math">\(\int_a^{ab} \frac{1}{t} \dee t = \int_\frac{a}{a}^\frac{ab}{a} \frac{1}{ua} a \dee u = \int_1^b \frac{1}{u} \dee u\)</span>.<br />So <span class="math">\(\int_1^{ab} \frac{1}{t} \dee t = \int_1^a \frac{1}{t} \dee t + \int_a^{ab} \frac{1}{t} \dee t = \int_1^a \frac{1}{t} \dee t + \int_1^b \frac{1}{u} \dee u\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dummy variables can be swapped for any value, even functions like <span class="math">\(f(t)\)</span>.</p>
<h1 id="section-1">8/1/14</h1>
<p>To prove property 2, we need to show that <span class="math">\(\int_1^{a^r} \frac{1}{u} \dee u = r \int_1^a \frac{1}{t} \dee t\)</span>. To do this, we find a substitution that results in the desired limits of integration.</p>
<p>To prove property 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Select some <span class="math">\(u\)</span>.<br />We want to prove that <span class="math">\(\int_1^{a^r} \frac{1}{t} \dee t = r \int_1^a \frac{1}{t} \dee t\)</span>.<br />Let <span class="math">\(u = t^\frac{1}{r}\)</span>, so <span class="math">\(t = u^r\)</span>. Then <span class="math">\(\dee t = \frac{\dee t}{\dee u} \dee u = \frac{\dee}{\dee u} u^r \dee u = ru^{r - 1} \dee u\)</span>.<br />So <span class="math">\(\int_1^{a^r} \frac{1}{t} \dee t = \int_{1^\frac{1}{r}}^{{a^r}^\frac{1}{r}} \frac{1}{u^r} ru^{r - 1} \dee u = \int_1^a \frac{1}{u} r \dee u = r \int_1^a \frac{1}{u} \dee u\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="differentiating-with-respect-to-functions">Differentiating with respect to functions</h3>
<p>As an aside, we can actually differentiate things with respect to functions.</p>
<p>The important property is that <span class="math">\(\frac{\dee x}{\dee b(x)} = \frac{1}{\frac{\dee b(x)}{\dee x}}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Note that <span class="math">\(\frac{\dee a(x)}{\dee b(x)} = \frac{\dee a(x)}{\dee x} \frac{\dee x}{\dee b(x)} = \frac{\dee a(x)}{\dee x} \frac{1}{\frac{\dee b(x)}{\dee x}}\)</span>.</p>
<p>So <span class="math">\(\frac{\dee a(x)}{\dee b(x)} = \frac{\frac{\dee a(x)}{\dee x}}{\frac{\dee b(x)}{\dee x}} = \frac{a&#39;(x)}{b&#39;(x)}\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="integration-by-parts">Integration by Parts</h3>
<p>We often have integrands that are products. For example, <span class="math">\(\int x \sin x \dee x\)</span></p>
<p>It would be nice to be able to differentiate or integrate just one of the factors rather than having to do the whole thing.</p>
<p>Recall the product rule: <span class="math">\(\frac{\dee}{\dee x} (a(x) b(x)) = (\frac{\dee}{\dee x} a(x)) b(x) + a(x) \frac{\dee}{\dee x} b(x)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Move the last term to the left: <span class="math">\((\frac{\dee}{\dee x} a(x)) b(x) = \frac{\dee}{\dee x} (a(x) b(x)) - a(x) \frac{\dee}{\dee x} b(x)\)</span>.</p>
<p>If we integrate both sides with respect to <span class="math">\(x\)</span>, we get: <span class="math">\(\int (\frac{\dee}{\dee x} a(x)) b(x) = \int \frac{\dee}{\dee x} a(x) b(x) - \int a(x) \frac{\dee}{\dee x} b(x)\)</span>.</p>
<p>By FTC2, <span class="math">\(\int (\frac{\dee}{\dee x} a(x)) b(x) = a(x) b(x) + c - \int a(x) \frac{\dee}{\dee x} b(x)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Since there would also be a <span class="math">\(c\)</span> term from the second integral, we don't need to write it. So <span class="math">\(\int (\frac{\dee}{\dee x} a(x)) b(x) \dee x = a(x) b(x) - \int a(x) \frac{\dee}{\dee x} b(x) \dee x\)</span>.</p>
<p>This is the <strong>integration by parts rule</strong>.</p>
<p>Using the same idea, we find that <span class="math">\(\int_a^b (\frac{\dee}{\dee x} a(x)) b(x) = \evalat{a(x) b(x)}_{x = a}^{x = b} - \int_a^b a(x) \frac{\dee}{\dee x} b(x)\)</span>.</p>
<p>When we use the rule, we want to identify two parts of the product such that one of the parts (b) is the factor that becomes <strong>simpler when differentiated</strong>, and the other part (a) is chosen as the <strong>integral of the factor</strong>.</p>
<p>Simplify <span class="math">\(\int x \sin x \dee x\)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="math">\(x\)</span> is much simpler when differentiated. Let <span class="math">\(b(x) = x\)</span>.<br /><span class="math">\(\sin x\)</span> is integrable. Let <span class="math">\(a(x) = \int \sin x = -\cos x\)</span>.<br />So <span class="math">\(\int x \sin x = \int x \frac{\dee}{\dee x} (-\cos x) = -x \cos x - \int (-\cos x) 1 \dee x\)</span>, by integration by parts.<br />So <span class="math">\(-x \cos x - \int (-\cos x) 1 \dee x = -x \cos x + \sin x + c\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can check the answer by differentiating: <span class="math">\(\frac{\dee}{\dee x} (-x \cos x + \sin x + c) = x \sin x\)</span>.</p>
<p>When we use integration by parts, we differentiate one factor, and integrate the other. Then, we can apply the integration by parts formula and obtain a possibly simpler version.</p>
<p>Simplify <span class="math">\(\int_0^1 x e^{-x} \dee x\)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>;wip</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Simplify <span class="math">\(\int_0^1 x^n (\ln x)^n \dee x\)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>;wip</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We often write the integration by parts formula in different forms: <span class="math">\(\int a \dee b = uv - \int v \dee u\)</span>, or <span class="math">\(\int f&#39;(x) g(x) \dee x = f(x) g(x) - \int f(x) g&#39;(x) \dee x\)</span>.</p>
<p>An interesting trick is that we can use integration by parts to integrate anything, since everything is a product of itself and 1.</p>
<p>For example, consider <span class="math">\(\int \arcsin x \dee x\)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clearly, <span class="math">\(\int 1 \cdot \arcsin x \dee x = \int (\frac{\dee}{\dee x} x) \arcsin x \dee x\)</span>.<br />Using integration by parts, with <span class="math">\(a(x) = x, b(x) = \arcsin x\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\int (\frac{\dee}{\dee x} x) \arcsin x \dee x = x \arcsin x - \int \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \dee x\)</span>.<br />We can now use integration by substitution with <span class="math">\(u = 1 - x^2\)</span> to simplify <span class="math">\(\int \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \dee x\)</span>.<br />Clearly, <span class="math">\(\dee x = -\frac{1}{2x} \dee x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \dee x = -\frac{1}{2} \int \frac{1}{\sqrt{u}} \dee u = -\frac{1}{2} \int u^{-\frac{1}{2}} \dee u = -\frac{1}{2} 2 \sqrt{u} + c = -\sqrt{1 - x^2} + c\)</span>.<br />So <span class="math">\(\int \arcsin x \dee x = x \arcsin x - \int \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \dee x = x \arcsin x + \sqrt{1 - x^2} + c\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Simplify <span class="math">\(\int \arccos x \dee x\)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using integration by parts, with <span class="math">\(a(x) = x, b(x) = \arccos x\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\int (\frac{\dee}{\dee x} x) \arccos x \dee x = x \arccos x - \int \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \dee x\)</span>.<br />From the previous question, we know that <span class="math">\(\int \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \dee x = -\sqrt{1 - x^2} + c\)</span>.<br />So <span class="math">\(\int (\frac{\dee}{\dee x} x) \arccos x \dee x = x \arccos x - \int \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \dee x = x \arccos x + \sqrt{1 - x^2} + c\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Simplify <span class="math">\(\int \ln x \dee x\)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using integration by parts, with <span class="math">\(a(x) = x, b(x) = \arccos x\)</span>. <span class="math">\(\int (\frac{\dee}{\dee x} x) \ln x \dee x = x \ln x - \int \frac{x}{x} \dee x = x \ln x - x\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="section-2">10/1/14</h1>
<p>The integration by parts rule is also written as <span class="math">\(\int v \dee u = uv - \int u \dee v\)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clearly, <span class="math">\(\dee a = \frac{\dee a}{\dee x} \dee x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\dee b = \frac{\dee b}{\dee x} \dee x\)</span>.<br />We know that <span class="math">\(\int (\frac{\dee}{\dee x} a(x)) b(x) \dee x = a(x) b(x) - \int a(x) \frac{\dee}{\dee x} b(x) \dee x\)</span> and so <span class="math">\(\int \frac{\dee a}{\dee x} b(x) \dee x = a(x) b(x) - \int a(x) \frac{\dee b}{\dee x} \dee x\)</span>.<br />So <span class="math">\(\int b(x) \dee a = a(x) b(x) - \int a(x) \dee b\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>;wip: work on assignment 1 in math138 and 136</p>
<p>We can also write it as <span class="math">\(\int f(x) g(x) \dee x = \int f(x) \dee x g(x) - \int \int f(x) \dee x \frac{\dee g}{\dee x} \dee x\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="getting-back-what-we-started-with">Getting Back What We Started With</h3>
<p>Consider <span class="math">\(I = \int e^{-x} \sin x\)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We choose <span class="math">\(\frac{\dee}{\dee x} e^{-x} = -e^{-x}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\int \sin x \dee x = -\cos x\)</span>.<br />So <span class="math">\(I = \int e^{-x} \frac{\dee}{\dee x} (-\cos x) \dee x = e^{-x} (-\cos x) - \int e^{-x} \cos x\)</span>.<br />We choose <span class="math">\(\frac{\dee}{\dee x} (-e^{-x}) = e^{-x}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\int \cos x \dee x = \sin x\)</span>.<br />Clearly, <span class="math">\(\int e^{-x} \cos x = \int e^{-x} \frac{\dee}{\dee x} \sin x = e^{-x} \sin x - \int (-e^{-x}) \sin x = e^{-x} \sin x + I\)</span>.<br />So <span class="math">\(I = -e^{-x} \cos x - \int e^{-x} \cos x = -e^{-x} \cos x - e^{-x} \sin x - I\)</span>.<br />So <span class="math">\(2I = -e^{-x} (\cos x + \sin x)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(I = -\frac{1}{2}e^{-x} (\cos x + \sin x)\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, we used integration by parts to rewrite the expression, then used integration by parts again to simplify the remaining integral. In doing so we obtained a result that contained the original expression, which we substituted and solved algebraically.</p>
<p>This technique is only really useful for problems of the form <span class="math">\(\int e^{ax} \sin bx \dee x\)</span> or <span class="math">\(\int e^{ax} \cos bx \dee x\)</span>.</p>
<p>Simplify <span class="math">\(\int_0^1 (-\ln x)^n \dee x, n \in \mb{N}\)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We will try it for the first few values of <span class="math">\(n\)</span>.<br />For <span class="math">\(n = 1\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\int_0^1 (-\ln x)^n \dee x = -\int_0^1 1 \ln x \dee x = -\int_0^1 \ln x \frac{\dee}{\dee x} x = -\evalat{x \ln x}_0^1 + \int_0^1 x \frac{1}{x} = -1 \ln 1 + 0 \ln 0 + 1\)</span> (indeterminate form <span class="math">\(0 \cdot -\infty\)</span>).<br />This is a thing known as an improper integral (covered later in the course).<br />We can solve it because what we really want is <span class="math">\(\lim_{x \to 0} x \ln x = \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\ln x}{\frac{1}{x}} \lH \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\frac{1}{x}}{-\frac{1}{x^2}} = \lim_{x \to 0} (-x) = 0\)</span> rather than the value <span class="math">\(0 \ln 0\)</span>.<br />So <span class="math">\(-\int_0^1 \ln x \dee x = -1 \ln 1 + 0 + 1 = 1\)</span>.<br />If we repeat this for <span class="math">\(n = 2, 3, \ldots\)</span>, we find that <span class="math">\(\int_0^1 (-\ln x)^n \dee x = n!, n \in \mb{N}\)</span>, yet it also works for fractional values of <span class="math">\(n\)</span> - this is the generalized factorial over positive real numbers!<br />;wip: use induction</p>

<h1 id="section-3">13/1/14</h1>
<h2 id="trigonometric-substitution">Trigonometric Substitution</h2>
<p>This is integration by substitution with the substitution using trignonometric functions.</p>
<p>We use trigonometric functions in our substitutions and use trigonometric identities to simplify the integrand.</p>
<p>We will need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pythagorean theorem: <span class="math">\(\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1\)</span></li>
<li>Half angle cosine formula: <span class="math">\(\cos^2 \theta = \frac{1}{2}(1 + \cos 2\theta)\)</span></li>
<li>Half angle sine formula: <span class="math">\(\sin^2 \theta = \frac{1}{2}(1 - \cos 2\theta)\)</span></li>
<li>Pythagorean theorem divided by <span class="math">\(\cos^2 \theta\)</span>: <span class="math">\(1 + \tan^2 \theta = \sec^2 \theta\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>We usually need this method when we have a square root of a quadratic expression.</p>
<p>Common substitutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <span class="math">\(1 - \sin^2 = \cos^2 \theta\)</span> to turn <span class="math">\(\sqrt{1 - x^2}\)</span> into <span class="math">\(\cos \theta\)</span> via <span class="math">\(x = \sin \theta\)</span>.</li>
<li>Use <span class="math">\(1 + \tan^2 \theta = \sec^2 \theta\)</span> to turn <span class="math">\(\sqrt{1 + x^2}\)</span> into <span class="math">\(\sec \theta\)</span> via <span class="math">\(x = \tan \theta\)</span>.</li>
<li>Use <span class="math">\(\sec^2 \theta - 1 = \tan^2 \theta\)</span> to turn <span class="math">\(\sqrt{x^2 - 1}\)</span> into <span class="math">\(\tan \theta\)</span> via <span class="math">\(x = \sec \theta\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using this technique, we can replace <span class="math">\(\sqrt{\pm a^2 \pm x^2}\)</span> with trigonometric functions, and then use trigonometric identities on them. Afterwards, we might simplify by changing the trigonometric functions back into square roots.</p>
<p>Derivatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(\cos&#39; \theta = -\sin \theta\)</span> (<span class="math">\(-\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta &lt; \frac{\pi}{2}\)</span>)</li>

<p>Consider <span class="math">\(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{3 + 2}{2 \cdot 3} = \frac{5}{6}\)</span>.</p>
<p>What if we went the opposite way? We go from <span class="math">\(\frac{5}{6}\)</span> to <span class="math">\(\frac{A}{2} + \frac{B}{3}\)</span> by factoring <span class="math">\(6\)</span>, and then solve for possible solutions for <span class="math">\(3A + 2B = 5\)</span> and pick <span class="math">\(A = 1, B = 1\)</span>. Now we have <span class="math">\(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3}\)</span>, as required.</p>
<p>This can also be done with polynomials. Using this technique, we can integrate <strong>rational functions of polynomials</strong>.</p>
<p>Consider <span class="math">\(\int \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \dee x\)</span>. We can always factor polynomials into a set of linear factors <span class="math">\(Q(x) = (x + c_1) \cdot \ldots \cdot (x + c_n)\)</span>.</p>
<p>So <span class="math">\(\int \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \dee x = \int \frac{P(x)}{(x + c_1) \cdot \ldots \cdot (x + c_n)} \dee x = \int \frac{A_1}{x + c_1} \dee x + \ldots + \int \frac{A_n}{x + c_n} \dee x\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now we have a bunch of integrals of constants over <span class="math">\(x\)</span> with offsets. This is easily integrated into logarithms.</p>
<p>We can solve for <span class="math">\(A_1, \ldots, A_n\)</span> by cross multiplying: <span class="math">\(\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} = \frac{A_1 ((x + c_2) \cdot \ldots \cdot (x + c_n)) + \ldots + A_n ((x + c_1) \cdot \ldots \cdot (x + c_{n - 1}))}{(x + c_1) \cdot \ldots \cdot (x + c_n)}\)</span>.

<h2 id="volumes-of-solids">Volumes of Solids</h2>
<p>Recall that a single-variable integral can be geometrically interpreted as the area underneath the curve.</p>
<p>In the Riemann integral, that would be represented as <span class="math">\(\int_a^b f(x) \dee x = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i = 1}^n \delta x_i f(x_i)\)</span>. Here, <span class="math">\(\delta x_i\)</span> is the base, and <span class="math">\(f(x_i)\)</span> is the height, and they form a rectangle.</p>
<p>The same idea can be applied to 3D, for the volume under a surface. We want to find the area under <span class="math">\(f(x, y)\)</span>.</p>
<p>In the Riemann integral, that would be represented as <span class="math">\(\int \int f(x, y) \dee x \dee y = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i = 1}^n \sum_{j = 1}^n \delta x_i \delta y_i f(x_i, y_i)\)</span>. Here, <span class="math">\(\delta x_i \delta y_i\)</span> is the base, and <span class="math">\(f(x_i, y_i)\)</span>, and they form a rectangle.</p>
<p>;wip: use double integration symbol above</p>
<p>In general, the volume of an arbitrary solid requires a multi-variable/multi-dimensional integral (a calculus III topic). However, there are cases where symmetry allows us to use a single variable integral.</p>
<p>Main axes:</p>
<pre><code>   y
   |
   |
   |_____ x
  /
 /
z</code></pre>
<p>Find the volume of a square prism with dimensions <span class="math">\(b \times b \times h\)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The area of the base slice stays the same as we go along the z-axis - as we vary <span class="math">\(h\)</span>, the slice is still <span class="math">\(b \times b\)</span>.<br />So the volume is <span class="math">\(\int_0^h b^2 \dee x = b^2 \int_0^h 1 \dee x = b^2 h\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The basic idea is that we take the solid, slice the shape along one axis, then integrate the area as a function of the extent along the axis that we sliced along. This works because of the symmetry of some shapes that allows us to avoid considering some dimensions.</p>
<p><span class="math">\(V = \int_a^b A(x) \dee x\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(V\)</span> is the volume, <span class="math">\(A(x)\)</span> is the area of a slice at extent <span class="math">\(x\)</span> (though other axes can be used too depending on the problem), and <span class="math">\(\dee x\)</span> is the width of the slice.</p>
<p>Find the area of the cone with base radius 1 unit and height 1 pointing along the x-axis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the same as the line <span class="math">\(y = 1 - x\)</span> rotated about the x-axis.<br />The area of any slice of the cone along the x-axis is <span class="math">\(A(x) = \pi (1 - x)^2\)</span>, because the slice is a circle.<br />The thickness of this slice is <span class="math">\(\dee x\)</span>, and the cone is defined from <span class="math">\(x = 0\)</span> to <span class="math">\(x = 1\)</span>.<br />So the volume of the cone is <span class="math">\(\int_0^1 \pi (1 - x)^2 \dee x = \pi \int_0^1 (1 - 2x + x^2) \dee x = \frac{\pi}{3}\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can generalize this to any function rotated about a line. The resulting solids are called <strong>solids of rotation</strong>.</p>
<p>The reason this works is because the z-axis is basically redundant information that is already expressed in the y-axis.</p>
<p>Find the volume of the solid represented by rotating <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span> about the x-axis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The area of each slice at each extent along the x-axis is the area of a circle with the radius <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span>.<br />The area function is <span class="math">\(A(x) = \pi f(x)^2\)</span>.<br />So the volume is <span class="math">\(\int_a^b A(x) \dee x = \pi \int_a^b f(x)^2 \dee x\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="section-7">22/1/14</h1>
<p>;wip: figure out how to find the length of a line</p>
<p>The rotation method works whenever we can find the area function for a given slice along a certain axis.</p>
<p>Here, <span class="math">\(\delta V = A(x) \delta x\)</span>, and then we add up all these tiny volumes to get the total volume.</p>
<p>This method is called the <strong>method of disks</strong>, because we are integrating the volume of a lot of small disks along the axis of rotation.</p>
<p>There is another way to approximate the area and have it converge into an exact value. We can estimate the volume of solids of rotation by integrating the volume of a lot of nested cylinders perpendicular to the axis of rotation - this is the <strong>method of shells</strong>.</p>
<p>Consider a hollow cylinder of thickness <span class="math">\(\dee x\)</span> with inner radius <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and height <span class="math">\(h(x)\)</span>. If we cut it and unroll it, then it becomes very close to a cuboid of dimensions <span class="math">\(2\pi x\)</span> by <span class="math">\(h(x)\)</span> by <span class="math">\(\dee x\)</span>. In other words, we assume the inner circumference is almost the same as the outer circumference, since <span class="math">\(\dee x\)</span> is so small.</p>
<p>So the enclosed volume of the cylinder is <span class="math">\(2\pi x h(x) \dee x\)</span>.</p>
<p>How do we use these shells to find the volume of a solid? If we look at the cross section of our shape, we can approximate the area of this cross section using rectangles that have a fixed width <span class="math">\(\dee x\)</span> perpendicular to the axis of rotation, and length <span class="math">\(h(x)\)</span> along the axis of rotation.</p>
<p>Then the volume of the solid is the sum of the volume of all the nested cylinders: <span class="math">\(\int_a^b 2 \pi x h(x) \dee x\)</span>.</p>
<p>Consider a cone extending along the x-axis represented by the equation <span class="math">\(y = 1 - x\)</span> from 0 to 1 rotated about the x-axis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We want the height of the cylinder at each point along the y-axis, an axis perpendicular to the axis of rotation.<br />The height is <span class="math">\(x = 1 - y\)</span>. So the volume of the shell at any extent along the radius is <span class="math">\(2 \pi y(1 - y) \dee x\)</span>.<br />So the volume is <span class="math">\(\int_0^1 2 \pi y(1 - y) \dee y\)</span>. Note that we only integrate from the axis of rotation to the radius, not the diameter, because the cylinders go around over to the other side.<br />So the volume is <span class="math">\(\frac{\pi}{3}\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finding the height of the shell is not always the same as finding the inverse. Consider the bowl-like shape formed by rotating <span class="math">\(y = \sqrt{x}\)</span> from 0 to 0 about the y-axis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We want the height of the bowl at each point along the x-axis, an axis perpendicular to the axis of rotation.<br />The height is <span class="math">\(y = 1 - x^2\)</span>, since the height of each cylinder is decreasing as we move outwards.<br />So the volume is <span class="math">\(\int_0^1 2 \pi x(1 - x^2) \dee x = \frac{\pi}{2}\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that this is the same as if we used <span class="math">\(x = y^2\)</span> (the inverse of the function). There are two possibilities for the cylinder height: either the inverse of the function, if the shape gets thinner as we move along the axis of rotation, or the maximum height minus the inverse, if the shape gets thicker as we move along the axis of rotation. Here, since the <span class="math">\(\sqrt{x}\)</span> shape gets thicker, we used <span class="math">\(1 - x^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>The method of shells works best when we know the height from the axis perpendicular to the axis of rotation, and the method of disks works when we can find the area of each slice along the axis of rotation.</p>
