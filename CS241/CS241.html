<p>Weekly assignments, 11 total.</p>
<p>A sequential program is an &quot;ordinary&quot; program - one that is not concurrent, parallel, or so on. Sequential programs only do one thing at a time - they are signle threaded.</p>
<p>As this course focuses on the foundation, we will be starting from the hardware, and figure out how sequential program works from there.</p>
<p>This course uses a simulated MIPS machine for the assignment. At the end we will be able to run a relatively complex C-like language that can run on the MIPS machine.</p>
<h2 id="binary-and-hexadecimal-numbers">Binary and Hexadecimal Numbers</h2>
<p>Refer to earlier notes for background.</p>
<p>A bit is a binary digit - a 0 or a 1. A nibble is a collection of 4 bits. A byte is a collection of 8 bits, although historically it could be any number needed to hold a signle character - sometimes 7. A word is the a machine-specific grouping of bits - the number of bits in an address on the computer.</p>
<p>In this course we will be using a 32-bit architecture.</p>
<p>Data in a computer's memory could mean anything - it is simply data.</p>
<p>There are a number of conventions for representing negative numbers in binary. The <strong>sign magnitude</strong> convention has the leftmost bit of a binary number represent whether it is negative. Although this system is simple, it's difficult to do math with since we have to treat the first bit separately for a lot of operations. Plus, there's two representations for the number 0 - <code>00...00</code> and <code>10...00</code>.</p>
<p>The <strong>one's complement</strong> convention has positive numbers written normally, and negative numbers are their magnitude with their bits flipped. This works better for certain operations, but there is still two 0 representations, which complicates things unnecessarily.</p>
<p>The <strong>two's complement</strong> convention has positive numbers written normally, and the negative numbers are simply their magnitude with their bits flipped and 1 added. The advantage of this system is that the first bit still denotes the sign. Plus, there is only one representation for 0, and operations like addition work as usual, modulo <span class="math">\(2^n\)</span>.</p>
<p>To find the numerical value of a number represented using <span class="math">\(n\)</span>-bit two's complement, we first check the sign bit. If 0, then we simply convert binary to a non-negative number as usual. Otherwise, we convert the binary to a non-negative number as usual, and subtract <span class="math">\(2^n\)</span> from that result to get a negative number as a result.</p>
<p>To quickly negate a binary number in two's complement quickly, flip all the bits and add 1. This allows us to</p>
<p>For 3-bit numbers, each binary string, in ascneding order, represents 0, 1, 2, 3, -4, -3, -2, -1.</p>
<p>A byte could also potentially be a character. Characters have multiple possibble encodings, such as unicode and ASCII. ASCII is a 7-bit code (for historical reasons, in order to avoid sending expensive bits) that has representations for most America-centric characters, although there are 8-bit extensions like those by IBM that add multilingual characters. In an 8-bit byte world, the eighth bit is 0 in standard ASCII. We will be using ASCII in this course to represent characters.</p>
<p>A byte could also be part of a data structure, or even part of an instruction. In this course, we have 32-bit instructions. A byte could also just be garbage - memory that isn't currently being used for anything and has no meaning.</p>
<p>The idea is that the meaning of a byte is whatever meaning we assign to it, and we have to remember what each little chunk of memory we're using actually means.</p>
<h1 id="section-1">8/1/15</h1>
<h2 id="the-machine">The Machine</h2>
<p>Computer programs operate on data, and are theselves data. Historically, the program code was stored in special memory such as punch cards or switches, and it operated on separate data memory. This was known as the Harvard architecture.</p>
<p>John Von Neumann proposed that we could just put the program code in the same memory as the rest of the data. This is known as the Von Neumann architecture. The result of program code being treated as just a program was that we can now write programs that operate on programs, even themselves. For example, operating systems, compilers, and viruses that modify existing code to do what it wants.</p>
<p>Machine language is specific to a particular processor type, like MIPS, ARM, and x86. In this course we will be using a simplified version of MIPS.</p>
<h3 id="architecture">Architecture</h3>
<p>The MIPS machine consists of a CPU and main memory (RAM), connected via a bus. The CPU contains the ALU, the registers, and the control unit.</p>
<p>The ALU (arithmetic logic unit) is responsible for doing arithmetic and logic, for doing things like addition and subtraction.</p>
<p>Registers are simply small pieces of memory that are really fast to work with since they are so close to the CPU - they are the fastest pieces of memory we have, ad we have relatively little of it. Most instructions can actually only work directly on registers, so we usually need to bring data from the main memory into registers before we work on them.</p>
<p>There are the 32-bit <strong>general purpose registers</strong> R00 to R31, which can be used for general purpose data storage. In our assembly code, we refer to them with $0, $1, $2, and so on, until $31. However, R00 is always 0, and R30 and R31 have other purposes in control flow by convention.</p>
<p>The <strong>program counter register</strong> is responsible for keeping track of where we are in the main memory for executing code. It holds an address to the next instruction to run while the current instruction is running. Some commands manipulate this register, so we can actually do control flow by modifying this in a certain way.</p>
<p>By convention, we guarantee that a certain address in memory like 0 always starts off with valid code, and then we initialize PC to that location. So when we start the machine, it will start executing instructions from that location and go onwards.</p>
<p>The <strong>instruction register</strong> IR is closely related to PC. Instead of holding the address of the next instruction, it holds the current instruction itself (not its address).</p>
<p>The HI/LO registers are a pair of registers that are useful for storing the output of operations like division, which results in the quotient and the remainder, stored in this pair of registers. They cannot be accessed directly, but are implicitly used by certain instructions.</p>
<p>The <strong>memory address register/memory data register</strong> MAR and MDR are used for working with memory. MAR is used to store the desired address for us to load, and MDR is used to store the loaded value.</p>
<p>MAR/MDR, PC, and IR are all hidden registers - they are not visible to our programs.</p>
<p>The control unit decodes instructions, and dispatches them to the rest of the computer to actually execute them.</p>
<p>There are many types of memory, such as registers, CPU cache, main memory, disk memory, and network memory, in order of increasing distance from the CPU. The closer the memory to the CPU, the faster it is to work with.</p>
<p>The main memory (RAM) is a large amount of memory stored away from the CPU, and communicates with the CPU over the bus (physically, a bunch of wires). It can be thought of as a huge array of <span class="math">\(n\)</span> bytes. Each byte in the RAM has an address, one of <span class="math">\(0, \ldots, n - 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Since a word in MIPS is 32 bits (4 bytes), and we can only access memory on word boundaries, we can only get or set addresses that are multiples of 4.</p>
<p>RAM access is much slower than register access - as much as three orders of magnitude. Usually, data in RAM must be transferred to registers before it can be used.</p>
<h3 id="instructions">Instructions</h3>
<p>It takes 5 bits to encode the 32 general purpose registers (we can't directly use the other registers as memory). Therefore, we need 15 bits to encode two source registers and a destination register. That means we have 17 bits left to encode the rest of our instruction.</p>
<p>There are actually only two instructions for working with RAM - load word and store word.</p>
<p>If we do something invalid like dereferencing an invalid address, our machine will simply crash. Real-world machines have machine exceptions to deal with this.</p>
<p>The CPU essentially works as follows:</p>
<pre><code>PC &lt;- 0
loop:
    IR &lt;- MEM[PC]
    PC &lt;- PC + 4
    decode and execute the instruction in IR</code></pre>
<p>A program gets executed by getting called by a <strong>loader</strong>, which puts the program into memory (from somewhere like the hard drive) and sets PC to the first instruction in the program. This is the role of the operating system when opening a program.</p>
<p>When our program wants to end, we want to return control flow back to the loader. This is done by setting PC to the next instruction of the loader after the one that started our program.</p>
<p>Conventionally, R31 is set to the address of the next instruction in the loader, by the loader - the address we need to jump to in order to return to the loader. Therefore, in our program code, we simply set PC to R31 in order to jump back to the loader. This looks something like <code>jr $31</code> in MIPS assembly.</p>
<p>Example code to add value in register 5 to register 7, then return:</p>
<pre><code>RAM LOCATION  BINARY                                   HEX         MEANING
------------  ---------------------------------------  ----------  --------------
00000000      0000 0000 1010 0111 0001 1000 0010 0000  0x00A71820  add $3, $5, $7
00000004      0000 0011 1110 0000 0000 0000 0000 1000  0x03e00008  jr $31</code></pre>
<p>To store a literal value into a register, we can use the <strong>load immediate and skip</strong> (<code>lis</code>) instruction. Essentially, ;wip</p>
