<p>A sequential program is an &quot;ordinary&quot; program - one that is not concurrent, parallel, or so on. Sequential programs only do one thing at a time - they are signle threaded.</p>
<p>As this course focuses on the foundation, we will be starting from the hardware, and figure out how sequential program works from there.</p>
<p>This course uses a simulated MIPS machine for the assignment. At the end we will be able to run a relatively complex C-like language that can run on the MIPS machine.</p>
<h2 id="binary-and-hexadecimal-numbers">Binary and Hexadecimal Numbers</h2>
<p>Refer to earlier notes for background.</p>
<p>A bit is a binary digit - a 0 or a 1. A nibble is a collection of 4 bits. A byte is a collection of 8 bits, although historically it could be any number needed to hold a signle character - sometimes 7. A word is the a machine-specific grouping of bits - the number of bits in an address on the computer.</p>
<p>In this course we will be using a 32-bit architecture.</p>
<p>Data in a computer's memory could mean anything - it is simply data.</p>
<p>There are a number of conventions for representing negative numbers in binary. The <strong>sign magnitude</strong> convention has the leftmost bit of a binary number represent whether it is negative. Although this system is simple, it's difficult to do math with since we have to treat the first bit separately for a lot of operations. Plus, there's two representations for the number 0 - <code>00...00</code> and <code>10...00</code>.</p>
<p>The <strong>one's complement</strong> convention has positive numbers written normally, and negative numbers are their magnitude with their bits flipped. This works better for certain operations, but there is still two 0 representations, which complicates things unnecessarily.</p>
<p>The <strong>two's complement</strong> convention has positive numbers written normally, and the negative numbers are simply their magnitude with their bits flipped and 1 added. The advantage of this system is that the first bit still denotes the sign. Plus, there is only one representation for 0, and operations like addition work as usual, modulo <span class="math">\(2^n\)</span>.</p>
<p>To find the numerical value of a number represented using <span class="math">\(n\)</span>-bit two's complement, we first check the sign bit. If 0, then we simply convert binary to a non-negative number as usual. Otherwise, we convert the binary to a non-negative number as usual, and subtract <span class="math">\(2^n\)</span> from that result to get a negative number as a result.</p>
<p>To quickly negate a binary number in two's complement quickly, flip all the bits and add 1. This allows us to</p>
<p>For 3-bit numbers, each binary string, in ascneding order, represents 0, 1, 2, 3, -4, -3, -2, -1.</p>
<p>A byte could also potentially be a character. Characters have multiple possibble encodings, such as unicode and ASCII. ASCII is a 7-bit code (for historical reasons, in order to avoid sending expensive bits) that has representations for most America-centric characters, although there are 8-bit extensions like those by IBM that add multilingual characters. In an 8-bit byte world, the eighth bit is 0 in standard ASCII. We will be using ASCII in this course to represent characters.</p>
<p>A byte could also be part of a data structure, or even part of an instruction. In this course, we have 32-bit instructions. A byte could also just be garbage - memory that isn't currently being used for anything and has no meaning.</p>
<p>The idea is that the meaning of a byte is whatever meaning we assign to it, and we have to remember what each little chunk of memory we're using actually means.</p>
