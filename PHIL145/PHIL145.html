<p>Critical Thinking</p>
<pre><code>Instructor: Michael &quot;Mike&quot; McEwan

<h1 id="section">6/1/14</h1>
<p>Midterm Feb. 25 in AL 116 4pm.</p>
<p>All exams are not cumulative, only covering half of the course materiel.</p>
<p>Make sure to read the course outline on LEARN.</p>
<p>This course uses i-Clickers. Register the clickers on the <a href="https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~pkates/uw-clicker.html">registration page</a>.</p>
<p>When emailing instructors, put &quot;Phil 145&quot; in the subject line.</p>
<p>Lectures supplement the lectures, covers the important parts of the readings.</p>
<p>People with laptops should <strong>sit at the back</strong>. I should probably bring my glasses in that case.</p>
<p>Lecture slides, announcements, and quizzes are available on LEARN.</p>
<p>General goal of course is to improve reasoning skills - differentiating between good/bad reasoning (evaluative), and communicate reasoning/evalutations of reasoning to others (coomunicative).</p>
<p>Topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Study of arguments - structure, logical forms, types, evaluative methods/standards, standardization of natural language arguments, fallacies.</li>
<li>Study of reasoning - features/constraints on human cognition, numbers, statistics, cognitive biases, social cognition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Common sense is not as common as it might seem. Ideas are only obvious after we have already been exposed to them. Human beings make systematic and widespread errors in their reasoning that seem perfectly reasonable.</p>

<p>Refer to CS135 notes for i-Clicker setup. The frequency code is BA.</p>
<p>What is critical thinking? How do we develop critical thinking skills?</p>
<p>Critical thinking is a <strong>type of thinking</strong> where one reasons in a <strong>reliable or successful way</strong>.</p>
<p>Reasoning is a cognitive process of deliberation that results in the formation of belief, a judgement, or a choice. This course focuses on beliefs.</p>
<p>One way to determine whether reasoning is successful or reliable is to consider the properties of the beliefs, judgements, and choices that it results in.</p>
<p>We want the resulting beliefs to be <strong>true</strong>, or at least <strong>probably true</strong>, and possibly others, like simplicity, coherence with other beliefs, correspondence with the world, etc.</p>
<p>So we want to reason successfully, and only successful reasoning results in true beliefs. Therefore:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Critical thinking is reasining in a way that leads to the production of true (or approximately or probably true) beliefs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We care about true beliefs because people are more likely to be successful (achieve their goals) if they act on true beliefs.</p>
<p>How do we learn to reason reliably?</p>
<p>There are two types of reasoning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Domain-specific reasoning is reasoning in a specific topic, like how chemistry classes teach one to reason well about what compounds will be produced in a given reaction.</li>
<li>Domain-general reasoning is reasoning that is applicable to any field, giving muh broader principles that work everywhere. This is the focus of this course.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Metacognitive approach</strong> is learning how to think about thinking. Learning to think well about a subject means learning new concepts and how to apply them. Likewise with reasoning. We will use these concepts to analyze, explain, criticise, and correct reasoning.</p>
<p>Critical thinking is a philosophy class for historical reasons, but there are also many connections between the fields. Math, science, psychology, and a lot of other fields are simply branches off of philosophy. Philisophical questions often require looking into domain-general reasoning, and has close connections to critical thinking.</p>
