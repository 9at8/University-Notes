<h1 id="section">6/1/14</h1>
<p>Midterm Feb. 25 in AL 116 4pm.</p>
<p>All exams are not cumulative, only covering half of the course materiel.</p>
<p>Make sure to read the course outline on LEARN.</p>
<p>This course uses i-Clickers. Register the clickers on the <a href="https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~pkates/uw-clicker.html">registration page</a>.</p>
<p>When emailing instructors, put &quot;Phil 145&quot; in the subject line.</p>
<p>Lectures supplement the lectures, covers the important parts of the readings.</p>
<p>People with laptops should <strong>sit at the back</strong>. I should probably bring my glasses in that case.</p>
<p>Lecture slides, announcements, and quizzes are available on LEARN.</p>
<p>General goal of course is to improve reasoning skills - differentiating between good/bad reasoning (evaluative), and communicate reasoning/evalutations of reasoning to others (coomunicative).</p>
<p>Topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Study of arguments - structure, logical forms, types, evaluative methods/standards, standardization of natural language arguments, fallacies.</li>
<li>Study of reasoning - features/constraints on human cognition, numbers, statistics, cognitive biases, social cognition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Common sense is not as common as it might seem. Ideas are only obvious after we have already been exposed to them. Human beings make systematic and widespread errors in their reasoning that seem perfectly reasonable.</p>
<h1 id="section-1">8/1/14</h1>
<h2 id="critical-thinking">Critical Thinking</h2>
<p>Refer to CS135 notes for i-Clicker setup. The frequency code is BA.</p>
<p>What is critical thinking? How do we develop critical thinking skills?</p>
<p>Critical thinking is a <strong>type of thinking</strong> where one reasons in a <strong>reliable or successful way</strong>.</p>
<p>Reasoning is a cognitive process of deliberation that results in the formation of belief, a judgement, or a choice. This course focuses on beliefs.</p>
<p>One way to determine whether reasoning is successful or reliable is to consider the properties of the beliefs, judgements, and choices that it results in.</p>
<p>We want the resulting beliefs to be <strong>true</strong>, or at least <strong>probably true</strong>, and possibly others, like simplicity, coherence with other beliefs, correspondence with the world, etc.</p>
<p>So we want to reason successfully, and only successful reasoning results in true beliefs. Therefore:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Critical thinking is reasining in a way that leads to the production of true (or approximately or probably true) beliefs.<br />Critical thinking is successful or reliable reasoning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We care about true beliefs because people are more likely to be successful (achieve their goals) if they act on true beliefs.</p>
<p>How do we learn to reason reliably?</p>
<p>There are two types of reasoning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Domain-specific reasoning is reasoning in a specific topic, like how chemistry classes teach one to reason well about what compounds will be produced in a given reaction.</li>
<li>Domain-general reasoning is reasoning that is applicable to any field, giving muh broader principles that work everywhere. This is the focus of this course.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Metacognitive approach</strong> is learning how to think about thinking. Learning to think well about a subject means learning new concepts and how to apply them. Likewise with reasoning. We will use these concepts to analyze, explain, criticise, and correct reasoning.</p>
<p>Critical thinking is a philosophy class for historical reasons, but there are also many connections between the fields. Math, science, psychology, and a lot of other fields are simply branches off of philosophy. Philisophical questions often require looking into domain-general reasoning, and has close connections to critical thinking.</p>
<h1 id="section-2">10/1/14</h1>
<p>COnsider Zeno's paradox:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Achilles wants to run from point A to B.</li>
<li>To do this, he must go from the first point to halfway to the second point.</li>
<li>He must also go to halfway again to the second point.</li>
<li>This repeats infinitely.</li>
<li>Therefore, Achilles can never finish the race.</li>
</ol>
<p>This argument seems reasonable, but the conclusion is clearly false. How is this possible? In fact, all the premises are true, but they do not support the conclusion.</p>
<p>This is because the distance becomes infinitely small, while the amount of time taken is also infinitely small. Mathematically, the sum of the times converges to a finite value even though there are an infinite number of times.</p>
<h2 id="reasoning">Reasoning</h2>
<p>Philisophical questions are often questions with no established methods for solving them. &quot;Is the stove on?&quot; has established methods for solving - check the stove.</p>
<p>Philosophers develop concepts and methods of looking at the reasoning about these questions. Domain-general reasoning is often the only way we can look a these problems when they are too new or difficult to solve otherwise. This is also useful in math, logic, science, etc.</p>
<p>Reasoning is the <strong>process of deliberation whereby one draws a conclusion</strong>.</p>
<p>One of our metacognitive abilities is <strong>the ability to give reasons</strong>. When we give reasons, we put the aspects of reasoning on display. Reasons are offered in support of the conclusion - they play a <strong>justificatory</strong> role.</p>
<p>When we examine reasons, we can evaluate the reliability of the reasoning and how acceptable the conclusions are.</p>
<p>Presenting an argument is a way of giving expression in language to our reasons - a way of putting reasoning on display.</p>
<p>The study of argumentation lets us hone our reasoning skllls.</p>
<p>An argument can mean a fight or a disagreement, but also a reasoned defence of a claim. We are more interested in the second definition.</p>
<p>An argument can also be abstracted into a set of premises implying a conclusion.</p>
<p>People can say the same words in the same sentence but communicate different things: &quot;one is a prime number.&quot;, &quot;is one a prime number?&quot;. How do we differentiate assertions, promises, threats, questions, etc. In the previous example, the two imply different relationships between the person (knowing vs. not knowing) and the claim snd asks different things of the audience (agreement vs. answering).</p>
<p>What is the real difference between these different ways of communicate the same words? Everything is said in a certain context, which is an important part of understanding the intent of the words.</p>
<p>Assertions are claims presented as true. By asserting a claim:</p>
<ul>
<li>We present the claim as true.</li>
<li>We invite people to agree, to invite others to form the belief that the claim is true.</li>
<li>We commit to either defend or retract assertions when challenged or when new evidence appears - a commitment to put reasoning on display when required to.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="section-3">13/1/14</h1>
<p>Committing to defending assertions has multiple benefits: filtering information, checking our beliefs against others', helping us change our minds, and explaining our reasoning being helpful for clarifying/organising our own beliefs.</p>
<p>The fundemental unit of rational exchange is the argument. Arguments show the reasonableness of an assertion - if the argument succeeds in doing so, everyone is justified in believing the assertion is true.</p>
<p>Two working definitions of arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Broad definition: argumentation is the practice by which we aim to show the reasonableness of an assertion. An argument is the thing presented when trying to meet this aim - a verbal or written object.</li>
<li>Narrow definition: an argument is a set of claims in which one or more of the claims, the premises, are offered as support of another claim, the conclusion - an abstract object.</li>
</ul>
<p>The broad definition focuses on the practice of argumentation and connects it to asertion - the communicative act.</p>
<p>The narrow definition focuses on the products of the communicative act.</p>
<p>Most things where the broad definition applies also has the narrow definition apply - the narrow definition is virtually a subset of the broad one.</p>
<p>Arguments are often presented as sets of sentences. We will be studying the narrow definition more in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>When is a set of sentences an argument? There must be a conclusion - an assertion - and premises that defend this assertion. A good argument has premises that the audience already accepts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Toronto is the largest city in Canada.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not an argument, because there is only a conclusion, without any suporting premises.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Will you get lost if you walk around Toronto?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is neither a conclusion or any premises.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don't get lost when you walk around Toronto. I will make fun of you forever if you do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are two assertions, both conclusions. Neither of the assertions support each other.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You will get lost of you walk around Toronto. It is the largest city in Canada.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an argument, though not a very strong one. The premise that the city is large implies that it is more likely that one will get lost.</p>
