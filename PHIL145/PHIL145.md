Midterm Feb. 25 in AL 116 4pm.

All exams are not cumulative, only covering half of the course materiel.

Make sure to read the course outline on LEARN.

This course uses i-Clickers. Register the clickers on the [registration page](https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~pkates/uw-clicker.html).

When emailing instructors, put "Phil 145" in the subject line.

Lectures supplement the lectures, covers the important parts of the readings.

People with laptops should **sit at the back**. I should probably bring my glasses in that case.

Lecture slides, announcements, and quizzes are available on LEARN.

General goal of course is to improve reasoning skills - differentiating between good/bad reasoning (evaluative), and communicate reasoning/evalutations of reasoning to others (coomunicative).

Topics:

* Study of arguments - structure, logical forms, types, evaluative methods/standards, standardization of natural language arguments, fallacies.
* Study of reasoning - features/constraints on human cognition, numbers, statistics, cognitive biases, social cognition.

Common sense is not as common as it might seem. Ideas are only obvious after we have already been exposed to them. Human beings make systematic and widespread errors in their reasoning that seem perfectly reasonable.

Critical Thinking
-----------------

Refer to CS135 notes for i-Clicker setup. The frequency code is BA.

What is critical thinking? How do we develop critical thinking skills?

Critical thinking is a **type of thinking** where one reasons in a **reliable or successful way**.

Reasoning is a cognitive process of deliberation that results in the formation of belief, a judgement, or a choice. This course focuses on beliefs.

One way to determine whether reasoning is successful or reliable is to consider the properties of the beliefs, judgements, and choices that it results in.

We want the resulting beliefs to be **true**, or at least **probably true**, and possibly others, like simplicity, coherence with other beliefs, correspondence with the world, etc.

So we want to reason successfully, and only successful reasoning results in true beliefs. Therefore:

> Critical thinking is reasining in a way that leads to the production of true (or approximately or probably true) beliefs.  
> Critical thinking is successful or reliable reasoning.  

We care about true beliefs because people are more likely to be successful (achieve their goals) if they act on true beliefs.

How do we learn to reason reliably?

There are two types of reasoning:

* Domain-specific reasoning is reasoning in a specific topic, like how chemistry classes teach one to reason well about what compounds will be produced in a given reaction.
* Domain-general reasoning is reasoning that is applicable to any field, giving muh broader principles that work everywhere. This is the focus of this course.

**Metacognitive approach** is learning how to think about thinking. Learning to think well about a subject means learning new concepts and how to apply them. Likewise with reasoning. We will use these concepts to analyze, explain, criticise, and correct reasoning.

Critical thinking is a philosophy class for historical reasons, but there are also many connections between the fields. Math, science, psychology, and a lot of other fields are simply branches off of philosophy. Philisophical questions often require looking into domain-general reasoning, and has close connections to critical thinking.

COnsider Zeno's paradox:

1. Achilles wants to run from point A to B.
2. To do this, he must go from the first point to halfway to the second point.
3. He must also go to halfway again to the second point.
4. This repeats infinitely.
5. Therefore, Achilles can never finish the race.

This argument seems reasonable, but the conclusion is clearly false. How is this possible? In fact, all the premises are true, but they do not support the conclusion.

This is because the distance becomes infinitely small, while the amount of time taken is also infinitely small. Mathematically, the sum of the times converges to a finite value even though there are an infinite number of times.

Reasoning
---------

Philisophical questions are often questions with no established methods for solving them. "Is the stove on?" has established methods for solving - check the stove.

Philosophers develop concepts and methods of looking at the reasoning about these questions. Domain-general reasoning is often the only way we can look a these problems when they are too new or difficult to solve otherwise. This is also useful in math, logic, science, etc.

Reasoning is the **process of deliberation whereby one draws a conclusion**.

One of our metacognitive abilities is **the ability to give reasons**. When we give reasons, we put the aspects of reasoning on display. Reasons are offered in support of the conclusion - they play a **justificatory** role.

When we examine reasons, we can evaluate the reliability of the reasoning and how acceptable the conclusions are.

Presenting an argument is a way of giving expression in language to our reasons - a way of putting reasoning on display.

The study of argumentation lets us hone our reasoning skllls.

An argument can mean a fight or a disagreement, but also a reasoned defence of a claim. We are more interested in the second definition.

An argument can also be abstracted into a set of premises implying a conclusion.

People can say the same words in the same sentence but communicate different things: "one is a prime number.", "is one a prime number?". How do we differentiate assertions, promises, threats, questions, etc. In the previous example, the two imply different relationships between the person (knowing vs. not knowing) and the claim snd asks different things of the audience (agreement vs. answering).

What is the real difference between these different ways of communicate the same words? Everything is said in a certain context, which is an important part of understanding the intent of the words.

Assertions are claims presented as true. By asserting a claim:

* We present the claim as true.
* We invite people to agree, to invite others to form the belief that the claim is true.
* We commit to either defend or retract assertions when challenged or when new evidence appears - a commitment to put reasoning on display when required to.

# 13/1/14

Committing to defending assertions has multiple benefits: filtering information, checking our beliefs against others', helping us change our minds, and explaining our reasoning being helpful for clarifying/organising our own beliefs.

### Identifying Arguments

The fundemental unit of rational exchange is the argument. Arguments show the reasonableness of an assertion - if the argument succeeds in doing so, everyone is justified in believing the assertion is true.

Two working definitions of arguments:

* Broad definition: argumentation is the practice by which we aim to show the reasonableness of an assertion. An argument is the thing presented when trying to meet this aim - a verbal or written object.
* Narrow definition: an argument is a set of claims in which one or more of the claims, the premises, are offered as support of another claim, the conclusion - an abstract object.

The broad definition focuses on the practice of argumentation and connects it to asertion - the communicative act.

The narrow definition focuses on the products of the communicative act. This is what we will focus on in this course.

Most things where the broad definition applies also has the narrow definition apply - the narrow definition is virtually a subset of the broad one.

Arguments are often presented as sets of sentences. We will be studying the narrow definition more in the coming weeks.

When is a set of sentences an argument? There must be a conclusion - an assertion - and premises that defend this assertion. A good argument has premises that the audience already accepts.

> Toronto is the largest city in Canada.

This is not an argument, because there is only a conclusion, without any suporting premises.

> Will you get lost if you walk around Toronto?

There is neither a conclusion or any premises.

> Don't get lost when you walk around Toronto. I will make fun of you forever if you do.

There are two assertions, both conclusions. Neither of the assertions support each other.

> You will get lost of you walk around Toronto. It is the largest city in Canada.

This is an argument, though not a very strong one. The premise that the city is large implies that it is more likely that one will get lost.

To determine whether something is an argument, all three of the following must be true:

* It must be a set of claims.
* It must have premises.
* It must have a conclusion.

# 15/1/14

Assertions are the same thing as claims in this course - the terms are interchangeable.

> Descartes argues that anyone who thinks, can know they exist. He reasons that a precondition f thinking is existance.

This is just reporting what was said, not an argument.

Note that the second sentence, describing Descartes' reasoning, does not support the claim that **Descartes said something what he did**. In other words, the second sentence does not support the first, because the seconbd sentence is a **report**.

Rules of thumb for identifying arguments:

* Arguments are usually represented by more than one sentence in English.
* Both conclusions and premises of arguments are generally statements, not questions or commands.
* Arguments are distinguished from reports in that reports make a series of assertions but do not attempt to support them.

Note that there are exceptions to these rules. For example, for the second point, a rhetorical question can make a claim in English, and so the conclusion can be a question. The context of the statements matters.

Sometimes arguments may be explicitly identified, with "I argue that <conclusion>", "This is because <premise>", "Therefore, <conclusion>", "It follows that <conclusion>".

Look out for conclusions not at the end of passages, implicit premises, implicit conclusions, and rhetorical questions.

### Explanations

An **explanation** differs from an argument in that the author intends that the conclusion is already believed by others, rather than trying to convince others. Arguments aim to how something is worth believing, while explanations make better sense of what is already believed. It is the intent of the author that is important.

Therefore, whether something is an argument or an explanation depends on whether the author thinks the audience already believes it: "Professional athletes are physically fit because they train every day" is an argument for people who don't believe that they are fit, and otherwise an explanation.

# 17/1/14

Arguments can be categorized by how the author intends for the premises to support the conclusion.

Overview of argument types:

Deductive arguments aim for **soundness**. They are **non-ampliative** and **truth-preserving** (we can never start with true premises and reach a false conclusion). Deductive arguments have their premises either support the conclusion perfectly, or not at all - they are all-or-nothing.

Sound deductive arguments guarantee the truth of the conclusion. A sound deductive argument is said to **entail** its conclusion.

An argument is **sound** if and only if it is **valid** and all the premises of the argument are **true**. To evaluate a deductive argument, we need to ensure that these two conditions are met.

An argument is **valid** if and only if there is no way for the conclusion to be false if the premises are true. If an argument is valid, then the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion. Valid arguments do not require us to look at the world - it only looks at the relationship between statements.

A valid argument does not tell us whether the premises are true, and therefore does not tell us if the conclusion is true.

We can prove that an argument is not valid by using the **method of counter-example**. A counter-example is a possible case where the premises are true, but the conclusion is false. We only need to find one counter-example to disprove validity. If there are no counter-examples, then the argument is proven valid.

    Prime numbers are only divisible by 1 and themselves.
    All even numbers are divisible by 2.
    -----------------------------------------------------
    All prime numbers are odd.

Here, a counter-example would be 2, which is prime but even.

We must be sure that the counter-example is possible:

    Either you are taller than me or you are shorter than me.
    You are not taller than me.
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    You are shorter than me.

Here, the counter-example "You are the same height" is not admissable because this does not satisfy the first premise.

Usually, the content of the argument determines whether it is valid:

    Bob is a bachelor
    -----------------------
    Bob is an unmarried man

In some special cases, the form of the argument itself is enough to determine whether it is valid:

    Bob is a bachelor
    -----------------
    Bob is a bachelor

A common form is **modus ponens**:

    If P, then Q
    P
    ------------
    Q

Another is **hypothetical syllogism**:

    If P, then Q
    If Q, then R
    ------------
    If P, then R

Here, P and Q represent claims that can be asserted. They can be as complicated as we like.

;wip: get that list of valid forms from the slides

We can combine argument forms to get more complex arguments. For example, hypotheical syllogism and modus ponens together:

    If P, then Q
    If Q, then R
    P
    ------------
    If P, then R ; derived premises
    ------------
    R

This is the basis of mathematical proof theory.

# 20/1/14

We can tentatively evaluate an argument's validity by matching it against the valid argument forms and trying to think of counter-examples.

    If Pi is less than 4, then God exists.
    Pi is less than 4.
    --------------------------------------
    God exists.

This is valid but not rationally compelling. Validity is not enough to determine whether an argument is "good".

Our goal is to obtain true conclusions.

However, arguments can be valid, yet have false conclusions. Additionally, they might not offer relevant support for the conclusion - the first premise in the above argument is unlikely to be accepted by the audience.

Validity is a property of the structure of an argument.

A premise can be supported by other premises. These other premises support a conclusion, which is then treated as a premise in our argument. These **sub-arguments** appear often in more complex arguments. All the subarguments must be valid for an argument to be valid. For example, the combined argument above can be written as:

* R, because:
    * If P, then R, because:
        * If P, then Q
        * If Q, then R
    * P

**Linked support** is when the premises only entail the conclusion together:

    The snow is white
    The grass is green
    ----------------------------------------
    The snow is white and the grass is green

**Convergent support** is when the premises independently entail the conclusion. Any one of the premises can make the conclusion true:

    The snow is white
    The grass is green
    ---------------------------------------
    The snow is white or the grass is green

We can diagram arguments with their subarguments as trees in node-arrow diagrams. We often number the statements and then label the nodes with the statement numbers.

Consider the following argument:

> It is either sunny or cloudy. If it is raining, then it is definitely not sunny. It is raining. Therefore, it is not sunny. Therefore, it is cloudy. Therefore, it is cloudy or Bob is your uncle.

We can write it as:

* It is cloudy or Bob is your uncle, because:
    * It is cloudy, because:
        * It is either sunny or cloudy
        * It is not sunny, because:
            * If it is raining, then it is definitely not sunny
            * It is raining

This argument is valid because each sub-argument is valid and it itself is valid.

### Truth

Truth is a property of sentences, not arguments or sets of statements. When we say an argument is true, we might mean that it is sound or rationally compelling.

**Truth conditions** are the conditions under which a sentence is true.

To assert a sentence means to claim it is true. We don't always know for sure if it is true or false.

However, we can judge whether we have good reason to believe the sentence is true or false. We therefore judge the whether it is reasonable to believe whether a deductive argument is sound.

**Contingent truths** are truths that happen to be true but could have been false if history went a different way. For example, "Waterloo has two universities" could have been false if history unfolded such that one of the universities did not start. Another might be "The Eiffel Tower is in France".

**Necessary truths** are truths that are true no matter which way history goes, or how the world developed. For example, "A bachelor is an unmarried man"

Similarly, **contingent falsehoods** (Waterloo has three universities) and **necessary falsehoods** (a bachelor is a married man) exist.

Necessary truths/falsehoods could be that way because of the **form**, or the **content**:

"A bachelor is an unmarried man" is a necessary truth because of the meaning of the word "bachelor", which is part of the content of the sentence.

"If it is raining, then it is raining" is a necessary truth because of the form of the argument itself, and does not require us to know what rain is.

> This sentence is false.

The above is neither necessarily true or necessarily false. It is known as the **Liar's sentence**. People have disagreed on the truth value of this sentence for a long time.

# 22/1/14

    The moon is made of cheese. Therefore, if God exists, then God exists.
    
    The moon is made of cheese
    ------------------------------
    If God exists, then God exists

This is a valid but unsound argument. This is because the truth of the premises always implies the truth of the conclusion - the conclusion is always true, so if the premises are true, then the conclusion is also true.

**Compound** or **complex** sentences can be constructed out of **atomic** sentences. The truth value of these sentences are often determined by the truth value of their component atomic sentences, as well as the **logcal connectives** between the atomic sentences.

An atomic sentence may be something like "It is raining" or "The sky is blue".

A complex sentence might be "It is raining, but it is warm". This is a **conjunctive** sentence - one made up of sub-sentences known as **conjuncts**, often joined by "and" or "but". The conjunctive statement works like a logical AND, with the form "P and Q".

Another might be "It is raining, or it is warm" (inclusive or). This is a **disjunctive** sentence - one made up of  sub-sentences known as **disjuncts**, often joined by "or". The disjunctive statement works like a logical OR, with the form "P or Q".

Sometimes, English implicitly specifies that disjunction is restricted: "You will pass the exam or fail it" implies that you cannot do both. Standard disjunction is an **inclusive or**, but the special restricted disjunction is an **exclusive or**. The restricted disjunctive statement is of the form "P or Q (but not both)", or "either P or Q".

If the type of disjunction is not specified, it is open for interpretation, but should be clarified.

A complex sentence like "if it is warm, then it is raining" is a **conditional sentence**. The condition is called the **antecedent**, and the result is called the **consequent**.

There are also multiple types of conditionals. The **material conditional** is always true unless the antecedent is true yet the conclusion is false.

It is still true when the antecedent is false because it cannot be invalidated that way.

There is also the **subjunctive conditionals**: "If Germany had won World War II, then the world would be no different today". This expresses a hypothetical claim - something that would be true if something else is true. The difference is that we already know the antecedent is false, but states what might happen if it were true. These are often distinguished by their using past tense.

A complex sentence like "it is not raining" is a **negated sentence** - one where a sentence is flipped around to give its opposite. The negated sentence works like a logical NOT, with the form "not P".
