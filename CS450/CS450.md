In this course, the main project (worth 30%) is to design a MIPS processor in Verilog. No required textbooks. The main topic is about how modern CPUs manage to achieve the performance that they do, building on top of the processor basics covered in earlier processor design courses.

There are also two written assignments (worth 20% total) and the final exam (worth 50%). Assignments have 4 grace days allowed.

Hardware description languages are used for modelling hardware, generally for the purpose of simulation or synthesis. Most complex digital hardware is designed using a hardware description language, which is then compiled and converted into specifications for FPGAs, ASICs, programmable logic, and so on.

The main hardware description languages in use today are System Verilog and VHDL. VHDL is more verbose and Ada-like, while Verilog is more minimalist and C-like. Most projects in industry use Verilog for this reason. System Verilog is a superset of plain Verilog, and all Verilog code works in System Verilog. There's also System C, which looks a lot more like C/C++, but it's not commonly used. In this course, we will be using Icarus Verilog (an implementation of System Verilog).

The simplest/lowest-level of hardware modelling in System Verilog is **gate-level modelling**. At this level, we have logic gate primitives like AND/OR, and we can connect them together into circuits via **wires**:

```verilog
# `a1` is the name of the gate, which is optional but useful for labelling gates
# `y` is the gate output, and `a`/`b`/`c` are the gate inputs (`and` supports one or more of these inputs, and one output)
# the inputs and outputs are wires, identified by name - everywhere that same name is used can be thought of as being all connected together by a physical wire
and a1(y, a, b, c)

# every argument except the last are the NOT gate's outputs, and the last one is the input
not (y1, y2, a)
```

In gate-level modelling, signal/wire values can be `0` (low), `1` (high), `x`/`X` (unknown/ignored value), or `z`/`Z` (high impedance).

Gate-level modelling for a full adder (addend bits as `a`/`b`, carry-in as `c_in`, carry-out as `c_out`, sum as `sum`):

```verilog
// full_adder_gate_level_modelling.sv
// for a full adder, `sum = a XOR b XOR c_in`, and `c_out = ((a XOR b) AND c_in) OR a AND b`

module full_adder(input a, b, c_in, output c_out, sum);
    // a logic is either a wire or a register - here, we're declaring our wires
    logic w1, w2, w3; // these are wires that are used for connecting gates in the full adder together
    xor x1(w1, a, b);
    xor x2(sum, w1, c_in);
    and a1(w2, a, b);
    and a2(w3, w1, c_in);
    or o1(c_out, w2, w3);
endmodule
```

This is a **design module**. It fully specifies the full adder as a self-contained unit.

While this looks like normal procedural code, with various function calls, it is more intuitive to think of this as a series of logical declarations - as if each of the `xor`/`and`/`or` lines were all continuously running at the same time.

A **test bench** is a set of definitions that instantiates the design module, and simulates the circuit under different input conditions to test for functional correctness. For our full adder example:

```verilog
// full_adder_test_bench.sv
module full_adder_test_bench;
    logic carry_in, x, y;
    logic carry_out, z;

    // "dut" stands for "device under test"
    // below, we're basically instantiating a full adder (defined in the code above) that's connected to our logics, for testing purposes
    // the `.name(other_name)` syntax is a "named port map", which lets us connect logics to devices by signal name
    // alternatively, we can just map the signals in order, like `full_adder dut(x, y, carry_in, carry_out, z)`, but this can cause issues if we change the inputs/outputs of the full adder
    full_adder dut(.c_out(carry_out), .sum(z), .c_in(carry_in), .a(x), .b(y));

    // this is a procedural block - inside, the statements are evaluated sequentially from top to bottom
    initial begin // run once at time 0
        carry_in = 0; x = 0; y = 0;
        // delays must be used to ensure statements actually run sequentially - statements in between delays all execute in parallel
        #10 x = 1; // delay 10 time units, then continue and set x to 1
        #10 y = 1; // delay 10 time units, then continue and set y to 1
        #10 carry_in = 1; // delay 10 time units, then continue and set carry_in to 1
        #10 $stop; // delay 10 time units, then stop the simulation (this will not compile if trying to generate hardware from this)
    end

    // now we want to dump the signals out into waveforms so we can see them
    initial $dumpvars(0, full_adder_test_bench); // the first parameter is the dump level (`0` means "dump all variables in the module and in the modules that instantiate it"), and the rest of the parameters are the module or variables to dump
endmodule
```

To compile, run `iverilog -g2005-sv -s full_adder_test_bench.sv -o full_adder.vvp full_adder.sv full_adder_test_bench.sv`:

* `iverilog` is the Icarus Verilog compiler.
* `-g2005-sv` specifies that the compiler should use the 2005 System Verilog standard.
* `-s full_adder_test_bench.sv` specifies the top-level/root module.
* `-o full_adder.vvp` specifies the output for the compiled Verilog.
* `full_adder.sv full_adder_test_bench.sv` specifies the modules to include in the compilation.

To simulate, run `vvp -n full_adder.vvp -lx2`:

* `vvp` is the Icarus Verilog simulation tool.
* `-n` specifies that `$stop` and Control-C should complete the simulation.
* `full_adder.vvp` is the compiled Verilog file for the full adder.
* `-lx2` specifies that the simulation should be written in LXT2 format, which is slower to process but more compact allows viewing waveforms while the simulation is running.

To view the waveforms: `gtkwave dump.lx2`:

* `gtkwave` is the GTK waveform visualizer tool.
* `dump.lx2` is the simulation result generated by `vvp`.
