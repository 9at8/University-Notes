<p>;wip: do assignment 0 and get on LEARN</p>
<h3 id="sets-and-combinatorics">Sets and Combinatorics</h3>
<p>Combinatorics is a discrete mathematics. Topics include enumeration (counting) and graph theory.</p>
<p>The <strong>size/cardinality</strong> of a set <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is denoted <span class="math">\(\abs{A}\)</span>. It is the number of elements it contains, if it is finite, and some other things if it is infinite.</p>
<p><span class="math">\([n]\)</span> is the set of all positive integers from 1 to <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, inclusive.</p>
<p>The <strong>Cartesian product</strong> of two sets <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> is <span class="math">\(A \times B = \set{(a, b) \middle| a \in A, b \in B}\)</span>. In other words, it is the set of all pairs of elements from both sets. This can easily be extended to more than two sets: <span class="math">\(A \times B \times C\)</span>.</p>
<p>If <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> are finite, then <span class="math">\(\abs{A \times B} = \abs{A}\abs{B}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Consider all possible results of throwing two six-sided dice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clearly, the set of all possible results for each die is <span class="math">\([6]\)</span> and <span class="math">\([6]\)</span>.<br />So the set of all possible results of both die is <span class="math">\([6] \times [6] = \set{(a, b) \middle| a, b \in [6]}\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Find the number of possible binary strings of length <span class="math">\(n\)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clearly, each digit in the string is of the set <span class="math">\(\set{0, 1}\)</span>, and there are <span class="math">\(n\)</span> digits.<br />Clearly, the number of possiblities are <span class="math">\(\abs{\set{0, 1} \times \ldots \times \set{0, 1}}\)</span> (<span class="math">\(n\)</span> times), or <span class="math">\(2^n\)</span>.<br />The set of possible binary strings is therefore <span class="math">\(\set{0, 1}^n\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(S  = A \cup B\)</span>. If <span class="math">\(A \cap B = \emptyset\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(\abs{S} = \abs{A} + \abs{B}\)</span>. In other words, if two sets share nothing in common, then their disjunction has a size equal to the sum of their sizes.</p>
<p>We could say that the Cartesian product is analogous to multiplcation, and disjunction is analogous to addition.</p>
<h3 id="permutations">Permutations</h3>
<p>A <strong>permutation</strong> is the rearrangement of the elements of <span class="math">\([n]\)</span> - an ordered set. For example, all permutations of <span class="math">\([3]\)</span> are <span class="math">\(\set{1, 2, 3}, \set{1, 3, 2}, \set{2, 1, 3}, \set{2, 3, 1}, \set{3, 1, 2}, \set{3, 2, 1}\)</span>.</p>
<p>In general, <span class="math">\([n]\)</span> has <span class="math">\(n!\)</span> permutations. We find these permutations by picking each of the <span class="math">\(n\)</span> elements for the first position, and for each of these, we pick each of the <span class="math">\(n - 1\)</span> remaining elements for the second, and for each of these, we pick each of the <span class="math">\(n - 2\)</span> remaining elements for the third, and so on.</p>
<p>For example, find the permutations of <span class="math">\(\set{1, 2, 3}\)</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, we choose 1 as the first position, so the remaining elements are <span class="math">\(\set{2, 3}\)</span>.<br />Now we choose each of 2 and 3 for the second position, to yield the permutations <span class="math">\(\set{1, 2, 3}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\set{1, 3, 2}\)</span>.<br />Second, we choose 2 as the first position, so the remaining elements are <span class="math">\(\set{1, 3}\)</span>.<br />Now we choose each of 1 and 3 for the second position, to yield the permutations <span class="math">\(\set{2, 1, 3}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\set{2, 3, 1}\)</span>.<br />Third, we choose 3 as the first position, so the remaining elements are <span class="math">\(\set{1, 2}\)</span>.<br />Now we choose each of 1 and 2 for the second position, to yield the permutations <span class="math">\(\set{3, 1, 2}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\set{3, 2, 1}\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every permutation is also a bijection, mapping elements from <span class="math">\([n]\)</span> into a different set. Formally, <span class="math">\(\sigma: [n] \to [n]\)</span>. For example, the permutation <span class="math">\(\set{2, 3, 1}\)</span> maps <span class="math">\(\set{A, B, C}\)</span> to <span class="math">\(\set{B, C, A}\)</span>. In other words, it behaves something like a function.</p>
<h3 id="combinations">Combinations</h3>
<p>A <strong>combination</strong> is a possible way of &quot;choosing&quot; <span class="math">\(k\)</span> elements of a set <span class="math">\([n]\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(k \le n\)</span>. In other words, it is a subset of size <span class="math">\(k\)</span> of the set <span class="math">\([n]\)</span>.</p>
<p>A subset of size <span class="math">\(k\)</span> is known as a <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-subset. A permutation of a <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-subset is a <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-permutation, and a combination of a <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-subset is a <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-combination.</p>
<p>We find these subsets by basically taking the first <span class="math">\(k\)</span> elements of each permutation. We then get the set containing all the possible <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-permutations, but each one is duplicated <span class="math">\((n - k)!\)</span> times because there are that many that start with those particular <span class="math">\(k\)</span> elements and are followed by all permutations of the remaining elements.</p>
<p>Therefore, there are <span class="math">\(\frac{n!}{(n - k)!}\)</span> <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-permutations of <span class="math">\([n]\)</span>. Clearly, each <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-combination corresponds to <span class="math">\(k!\)</span> <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-permutations, because combinations are basically permutations without order.</p>
<p>So the number of <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-combinations is a factor of <span class="math">\(k!\)</span> less than the number of <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-permutations, and is given by <span class="math">\(\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\)</span>.</p>
<p>In general, <span class="math">\([n]\)</span> has <span class="math">\(\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\)</span> combinations of size <span class="math">\(k\)</span>. This can be represented by <span class="math">\(n \choose k\)</span>.</p>

<p>;wip: midterm on July 3</p>
<h2 id="bijections">Bijections</h2>
<p>A <strong>bijection</strong> is a function that maps a set <span class="math">\(S\)</span> to another set <span class="math">\(T\)</span>, and is one to one and onto.</p>
<p>One to one means that the function has a unique element of <span class="math">\(T\)</span> for every value of <span class="math">\(S\)</span> - no two things in <span class="math">\(S\)</span> are mapped to the same element of <span class="math">\(T\)</span>. It is possible that <span class="math">\(T\)</span> is larger than <span class="math">\(S\)</span>, so <span class="math">\(\abs{T} \ge \abs{S}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Onto means that the function has a unique element of <span class="math">\(S\)</span> for every value of <span class="math">\(T\)</span> - every thing in <span class="math">\(T\)</span> must also have an element in <span class="math">\(S\)</span> that maps to it. Because there must be one element in <span class="math">\(S\)</span> for every element of <span class="math">\(T\)</span>, so <span class="math">\(\abs{S} \ge \abs{T}\)</span>.</p>
<p>A bijection is therefore a function that maps a set's elements to the elements of another set of the same size. Every element in either set has a unique corresponding element in the other set.</p>
<p>It is often tedious to prove that it is one to one and onto. We can prove a function is a bijection very easily, by proving that it has an inverse.</p>
<h3 id="bijection-inverse-theorem">Bijection Inverse Theorem</h3>
<p>Proposition: a function is a bijection if and only if it has an inverse.</p>
<p>Proof:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>;wip</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <strong>inverse</strong> of <span class="math">\(f: S \to T\)</span> is a function <span class="math">\(f^{-1}\)</span> such that x S, f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$ and <span class="math">\(\forall y \in T, f(f^{-1}(y)) = y\)</span>. It is basically a reverse mapping backwards from <span class="math">\(T\)</span> to <span class="math">\(S\)</span>.</p>
<p>For example, let <span class="math">\(S\)</span> be the set of all <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-subsets of <span class="math">\([n]\)</span> and <span class="math">\(T\)</span> be the set of all <span class="math">\((n - k)\)</span>-subsets of <span class="math">\([n]\)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If <span class="math">\(n = 3, k = 1\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(S = \set{\set{1}, \set{2}, \set{3}}, T = \set{\set{1, 2}, \set{1, 3}, \set{2, 3}}\)</span>.<br />One bijection over these sets would be <span class="math">\(f: S \to T\)</span> where <span class="math">\(f(A) = [n] \setdiff A\)</span>. This is a bijection because it maps every item in <span class="math">\(S\)</span> to a unique item in <span class="math">\(T\)</span>, with no items in <span class="math">\(T\)</span> left over. ;wip: is right? Also, since <span class="math">\(\abs{A} = k\)</span> and <span class="math">\(A \subseteq [n]\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\abs{f(A)} = \abs{[n]} - \abs{A} = n - k\)</span>, as required.<br />Clearly, <span class="math">\(f^{-1}(B) = [n] \setdiff B\)</span>. Since the function has an inverse, <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is a bijection and <span class="math">\(\abs{S} = \abs{T} = n \choose k = n \choose n - k\)</span>.<br />As an aside, we proved that <span class="math">\(n \choose k = n \choose n - k\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another example would be a mapping <span class="math">\(f: S \to T\)</span> where <span class="math">\(S\)</span> is all the subsets of <span class="math">\([n]\)</span> and <span class="math">\(T\)</span> is all binary strings of length <span class="math">\(n\)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An obvious bijection would be to map all the subsets to binary strings such that each digit is 1 if and only if the index of that digit is in the set.<br />Formally, we would write that as <span class="math">\(f(A) = a_n \cdots a_1, a_i = \begin{cases} 1 &amp;\text{if } i \in A \\ 0 &amp;\text{if } i \notin A \end{cases}, i \in [n]\)</span>.<br />We can also prove this is a bijection by finding its inverse: <span class="math">\(f^{-1}(a_n \cdots a_1) = \set{i \in [n] \middle| a_i = 1}\)</span>.<br />Since it is a bijection, <span class="math">\(\abs{S} = \abs{T}\)</span>, so there are the same number of subsets as there are binary strings of length <span class="math">\(n\)</span>.<br />Since there are <span class="math">\(2^n\)</span> possible binary strings, there are also <span class="math">\(2^n\)</span> subsets of <span class="math">\([n]\)</span>.<br />This also gives us an algorithm for listing all the subsets. Since binary strings are easy to list by counting upwards, we simply apply <span class="math">\(f^{-1}\)</span> to the list of all the binary strings of length <span class="math">\(n\)</span> to get the subsets of <span class="math">\([n]\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="binomial-theorem">Binomial Theorem</h2>
<p>Proposition: <span class="math">\((1 + x)^n = \sum_{k = 0}^n {n \choose k} x^k\)</span>.</p>
<p>Clearly, <span class="math">\((1 + x)^n = (1 + x) \cdots (1 + x)\)</span>. Clearly, each term in the expansion takes either a <span class="math">\(1\)</span> or an <span class="math">\(x\)</span> from each of the factors.</p>
<p>For example, <span class="math">\((1 + x)^3 = (1 + x)(1 + x)(1 + x) = 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot x + 1 \cdot x \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot x \cdot x\)</span>. Clearly, the factors of each term is in the Cartesian product of the set <span class="math">\(\set{1, x}^n\)</span>.</p>
<p>We can also represent this using a Cartesian product. Clearly, <span class="math">\(\set{1, x}^n = \set{(a_1, \ldots, a_n) \middle| a_1, \ldots, a_n \in \set{1, x}}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Therefore, <span class="math">\((1 + x)^n = \sum_{(a_1, \ldots, a_n) \in \set{1, x}^n} a_1 \cdots a_n\)</span>.</p>
<p>Clearly, each <span class="math">\(a_1 \cdots a_n\)</span> adds another <span class="math">\(x^k\)</span> where <span class="math">\(k\)</span> is the number of occurrences of <span class="math">\(x\)</span>. Since there are <span class="math">\(n \choose k\)</span> ways of picking <span class="math">\(k\)</span> occurrences of <span class="math">\(x\)</span>, and all possible combinations are in the Cartesian product, there are <span class="math">\(n \choose k\)</span> terms that are <span class="math">\(x^k\)</span>.</p>
<p>Since the highest power is <span class="math">\(x^n\)</span>, <span class="math">\((1 + x)^n = \sum_{k = 0}^n {n \choose k} x^k\)</span>.</p>
