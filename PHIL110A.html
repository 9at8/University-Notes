<h2 class="wmd-title" id="epistemology">Epistemology</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Episteme - to learn <br>
  Logos - study of  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Epistemology is the study of knowledge.</p>

<h2 class="wmd-title" id="metaphysics">Metaphysics</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Meta - "after" <br>
  Physics - book by Aristotle  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Metaphysics is the study of reality - "does God exist?" etc.</p>

<h2 class="wmd-title" id="logic">Logic</h2>

<p>Arguments are the fundamental unit of reasoning. The goal is to hold reasonable beliefs.</p>

<p><strong>Reason</strong> is identifiable cause, but in other uses it means <strong>justification or warrant</strong> - the ability for something to be rationally defended in the face of evidence.</p>

<p><strong>Assertion</strong> is the presentation of something as true. Conversations often have assertions, defences of assertions, and retractions of assertions.</p>

<h2 class="wmd-title" id="arguments">Arguments</h2>

<p>Argument is the presentation of reasons, as well as a set of statements presented as true. All but one of the statements are the premises, which support or establish the truth of the conclusion, the remaining statement.</p>

<p>An argument is a set of premises given in support of a conclusion. The conclusion may or may not follow from the conclusion, and the premises may or may not be true.</p>

<p>An argument is <strong>sound</strong> if and only if it is valid and all of its premises are true.</p>

<p>Argumentation is the practice of showing the reasonableness of an assertion.</p>

<p>A sound argument has reasonable premises that are mutually accepted; an argument is not sound if the premises are not reasonable, even if they happen to be true.</p>

<p>In formal logic, considerations of soundness are less often used. What is more important is <strong>validity</strong> - whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises. A valid argument is one where the conclusion is true if the premises are true.</p>

<p><strong>Inference</strong> is the act of reaching a conclusion on the basis of premises.</p>

<p>People infer conclusions, premises imply conclusions. Inference is only applicable to entities capable of acting.</p>

<p>Arguments are practical and linguistic objects. This means that an argument is both a practice (an activity that we do) and a collection of sentences (the thing itself).</p>

<h2 class="wmd-title" id="classical-logic">Classical Logic</h2>

<p>In Aristotle's time, logic terms where believed to only have one meaning/interpretation (univocal). It was also believed that there were three axioms from which all logic could be derived. This system is called classical logic:</p>

<ul>
<li>Law of Identity: P is true if and only if P is true, if P is a proposition.</li>
<li>Law of Non-Contradiction: P and not P is always false, if P is a proposition.</li>
<li>Law of Excluded Middle: P or not P is always true, if P is a proposition.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Intuitionistic logic</strong> is similar to classical logic, but excludes the law of excluded middle. As a result, in this system of logic, proofs cannot be made by contradiction (proving not P is false), and must be done directly.</p>

<p><strong>Dialethic logic</strong> is similar to classical logic, but excludes or restricts the law of non-contradiction. As a result, contradictions are possible (I am two meters tall and I am not two meters tall). This is useful in the legal system, where multiple precedents may give multiple contradictory answers, all of which are acceptable.</p>

<h2 class="wmd-title" id="reasoning">Reasoning</h2>

<p><strong>Fallacious arguments</strong> are arguments that are "bad". Fallacies are common errors in reasoning that result in bad arguments.</p>

<p>Arguments vs. explanations: arguments aim to show a statement worth believing, while an explanation aims to make better sense of something already believed. Sometimes, this may depend on context: "the ice is thicker over there because the ground slopes in that direction" could be either, depending on the situation.</p>

<p>Arguments and explanations can have many different assumptions. For example, the above assumed that the reader knows that ice is made by freezing water, and that water flows downward.</p>

<h2 class="wmd-title" id="deductive-logic">Deductive Logic</h2>

<pre><code>Socrates is a man. ; premise
All men are mortal. ;premise
------------------------------
Therefore, Socrates is mortal. ;conclusion
</code></pre>

<p>Replace with variables:</p>

<pre><code>S is an M.
All M are O.
---------------------
Therefore, S is an O.
</code></pre>

<p>This is the <strong>form</strong> of the argument, the basis or schema on which it is based.</p>

<p>This is also a valid argument - no matter what we substitute for S, M, and O, the argument is always valid.</p>

<pre><code>All dogs are birds. ;premise
All dogs have wings. ;premise
----------------------------
Therefore, birds have wings. ;conclusion
</code></pre>

<p>The above is a valid argument, but is not sound since dogs are not in fact birds.</p>

<p>A <strong>deductive argument</strong> is one where if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true. The validity of a deductive argument can be checked simply by looking at the argument form.</p>

<p>Deductive arguments have no new information in the conclusion - it is simply a rearrangement of the information in the premises.</p>

<p>Deductive is the same thing as valid; there are no invalid deductive arguments.</p>

<p>Deductive arguments are equivalent to implication, and can be written <span class="MathJax_Preview"></span><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-771-Frame" role="textbox" aria-readonly="true" style=""><nobr><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-8881" style="width: 8.823em; display: inline-block;"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 6.659em; height: 0px; font-size: 132%;"><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1.301em 1000.003em 2.546em -0.43em); top: -2.162em; left: 0.003em;"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-8882"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-8883" style="font-family: MathJax_Math; font-style: italic;">A</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-8884" style="font-family: MathJax_Main;">,</span><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-8885" style="font-family: MathJax_Math; font-style: italic; padding-left: 0.165em;">B</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-8886" style="font-family: MathJax_Main;">,</span><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-8887" style="font-family: MathJax_Math; font-style: italic; padding-left: 0.165em;">C<span style="display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; height: 1px; width: 0.057em;"></span></span><span class="mspace" id="MathJax-Span-8888" style="height: 0.003em; vertical-align: 0.003em; width: 0.273em; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden;"></span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-8889" style="font-family: MathJax_Main; padding-left: 0.273em;">‚üπ</span><span class="mspace" id="MathJax-Span-8890" style="height: 0.003em; vertical-align: 0.003em; width: 0.273em; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden;"></span><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-8891" style="font-family: MathJax_Math; font-style: italic; padding-left: 0.273em;">D</span></span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 2.167em;"></span></span></span><span style="border-left-width: 0.004em; border-left-style: solid; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: 0px; height: 1.361em; vertical-align: -0.354em;"></span></span></nobr></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-771">A, B, C \implies D</script>.</p>

<h2 class="wmd-title" id="inductive-logic">Inductive Logic</h2>

<p>Inductive arguments have new information in the conclusion.</p>

<pre><code>A goes to class every day and does well.
B goes to class every day and does well.
C goes to class every day and does well.
D goes to class every day.
========================================
Therefore, D does well.
</code></pre>

<p>The new information is that all other students who go to class also do well. An inductive argument only gives a certain probability of the conclusion being true.</p>

<p>A rational person would be entirely persuaded by a sound deductive argument. However, a rational person would only be more inclined to be persuaded by an inductive argument, depending on how strong it is.</p>

<h2 class="wmd-title" id="argument-properties">Argument Properties</h2>

<p>Valid arguments:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Premises</th>

<p>A valid argument can never have a false conclusion from true premises.</p>

<p>If we can find a case where the premises are true, but the conclusion is false, we can prove that the argument is invalid. This is known as a <strong>counterexample</strong>.</p>

<pre><code>All students are lazy.
This student is not lazy.
Therefore, the first statement is false.
</code></pre>

<p>Counterexamples can be used to disprove arguments.</p>

<p>Conditional arguments are a certain type of deductive argument, containing a conditional.</p>

<p>General form:</p>

<pre><code>if P, then Q.
(antecedent=if P), (consequent=then Q)
Four most common forms:
affirming the antecedent: if P, then Q. P, therefore Q.
denying the consequent: if P, then Q. ~Q, therefore ~P.
denying the antecedent: if P, then Q. ~P, therefore ~Q ; INVALID - Q could be true even if P isn't
affirming the consequent: if P, then Q. Q, therefore P ; INVALID - P could be false even if Q isn't

<h1 class="wmd-title" id="17/9/13">17/9/13</h1>

<p>In summary:</p>

<ul>
<li>Deductive arguments have no new information, and if the premises are true, so is the conclusion.</li>
<li>Inductive arguments have new information, and only suggest the conclusion is likely.</li>
</ul>

<p>True and false are, in the context of philosophy, applicable only to sentences. They do not apply to arguments. We can say each sentence in an argument is true, but we cannot say the argument itself is.</p>

<p>Validity vs. Soundness: we can pinpoint missing information in valid arguments, so we know what we need to know to make the argument sound. We can also save time on figuring out whether the premises are true if the argument is not valid.</p>

<p>Validity and soundness only apply to deductive arguments, by definition.</p>

<p>Induction by enumeration: listing examples and generalizing to obtain a conclusion. "this swan is white, that swan is white, therefore all swans are white".</p>

<p>Writing deductive arguments:</p>

<pre><code>A is a B     premise
All B are C  premise
-----------  single line
A is a C     conclusion
</code></pre>

<p>Writing inductive arguments:</p>

<pre><code>X_1 is a Y   premise
X_2 is a Y   premise
X_3 is a Y   premise
===========  double line
All X are Y  conclusion
</code></pre>

<p>An inductive argument is evaluated based on <strong>inductive strength</strong>. Inductive strength is based on how much new information is introduced in the argument. A weak inductive argument has low quality or few examples, while a strong inductive argument has high quality or many examples.</p>

<h2 class="wmd-title" id="fallacies">Fallacies</h2>

<p>Fallacies are common errors in reasoning. They occur frequently enough to have their own names.</p>

<p>Deductive fallacies include denying the antecedent and affirming the consequent.</p>

<p>Inductive fallacies include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Forgetful induction: forgetting about evidence contrary to the conclusion - "smoking is alright because I knew two people who smoked and lived long lives" - ignoring contrary evidence.</li>
<li>Hasty induction: jumping to conclusions, drawing conclusions without enough data: "this swan is black, so all swans must be black" - too much new information in the argument.</li>
</ul>

<h1 class="wmd-title" id="19/9/13">19/9/13</h1>

<h2 class="wmd-title" id="aristotle">Aristotle</h2>

<p>Student of Plato, who was a student of Socrates. Lived around 400BCE.</p>

<p>Aristotle stated that an object is something that has a beginning, a lifetime, and an end. A seed is an object, as it grows, lives, and dies. He uses the terms "object" and "substance" interchangably. An <strong>object</strong> is <strong>matter</strong> and <strong>form</strong>.</p>

<p>Matter is that which stays constant. The matter of a statue is bronze.</p>

<p>Form is like the definition of an object. It is the essence of the object, the essential characteristic of its nature - the kind of thing it is. The form of a statue is its statue-ness.</p>

<p>Aristotle believed that for humans, the male provided the form, and the female provided the matter, and the human was created from the two combining.</p>

<p>Objects can change throughtout their lifetime and still be the same object - as long as the form stays with it. "Form actualizes potential"; the kind of thing defines what changes it can potentially undergo. When the change happens, it is the form that brings it about. An acorn has the potential to become an oak tree, and the form brings this change about. Potential is a property of an object, the end state of the object that draws the object towards that state.</p>

<p>I eat a cake, and the cake becomes part of me. I do not become the cake because the potential of cake is to be eaten. The form of each object determines how it behaves.</p>

<h3 class="wmd-title" id="causes">Causes</h3>

<p>Aristotle on causation: there are four causes, ways of answering "Why x?" ("Why does water flow downhill?"):</p>

<ul>
<li>Material cause: what the object is made of, its matter (water matter)</li>
<li>Efficient cause: the events that brought something into existence (gravity)</li>
<li>Formal cause: what kind of thing the object is, its form (water-ness)</li>
<li>Final cause: the purpose for which it exists, its potential (to ensure plants are hydrated)</li>
</ul>

<p>Human causes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Material cause: human meat</li>
<li>Efficient cause: reproduction</li>
<li>Formal cause: human-ness/rational animal</li>
<li>Final cause: ??? (Aristotle believed these were philosophy and friendship)</li>
</ul>

<h1 class="wmd-title" id="23/9/13">23/9/13</h1>

<h3 class="wmd-title" id="teleology">Teleology</h3>

<p>Teleology is the study of purposes, final causes. Telos is the purpose/end/goal/reason. Logos is, among other things, the study of.</p>

<p>Aristotle thought the universe is orderly, and that <strong>everything has a purpose</strong>. The heart exists to distribute blood, and likewise everything exists for some end.</p>

<p>The job of the scientist is to figure out the purpose of objects.</p>

<p>The telos of the human is happiness, in exercising the most human aspect of us - rationality. Philosophy is the ultimate purpose of humans.</p>

<p>Humanity's role is to be the thinkers and philosophers of the universe.</p>

<h3 class="wmd-title" id="universe">Universe</h3>

<p>Aristotle's views on the universe are based on those of Ptolomy, a geocentric model.</p>

<p>The Earth is at the center of the universe, and it is surrounded by concentric spheres.</p>

<p>The innermost sphere is the sphere on which the moon is affixed.</p>

<p>The area within the innermost sphere is the <strong>sublunary realm</strong>. This area is more complex since it contains the four elements: <strong>Earth</strong>, <strong>Water</strong>, <strong>Air</strong>, <strong>Fire</strong>. The Earth is composed of concentric layers of these elements in that order. Everything is a mixture of these 4 elements. Humans are mostly Earth, but have some other elements.</p>

<p><strong>Natural motion</strong> is motion that is in accordance with the layers of elements. Rain falls because water is below air, and chalk falls down because earth is below air. We can throw the chalk, but this is <strong>unnatural motion</strong> because it is against the natural order of elements.</p>

<p>The area outside is the <strong>superlunary realm</strong>. This area is perfect, everything moves in perfect circles (considered the perfect shape). This is the area where the heavens, the stars, and sun are.</p>

<p>;wip: the structure of scientific revolutions</p>

<h3 class="wmd-title" id="science">Science</h3>

<p>A scientist is concerned with formal and final causes - to find the definition and purpose of objects.</p>

<p>These two causes are important because of their relation to change - why does change happen?</p>

<p>Observation is the tool of the scientist. For example, in a classroom, a scientist would try to find the kind and purpose of the group.</p>

<p>A scientist should look for the characteristics that <strong>all humans have</strong>, but <strong>no other things have</strong>. These would be the form. A human - a rational animal - is differentiated from a dog because of rationality, though they are both animals. A form is what allows categorization.</p>

<p>A scientist classifies things into categories, and tries to find the final cause. If the final cause of humans is to philosophize, then whenever the scientist sees another rational animal, it is known that the final cause of that human is also to philosophize.</p>

<h2 class="wmd-title" id="modern-philosophy">Modern Philosophy</h2>

<p>Modern philosophy is generally considered to be that done between the 1500s and the 1900s. It is characterized by the doubting of the foundations of our beliefs.</p>

<p>The major shift is between the Aristotelian "what are the forms?" to "how do I know my ideas are like the world?". There was also major religious, political, and scientific upheaval. There started to be the question of whether the world is really as it appears, whether everything was wrong or not.</p>

<p>Prominent philosophers/scientists in this era include Ren√©e Descartes, John Locke, and George Berkeley.</p>

<p>This was a time of revolutions and counter-revolutions - the rise of the scientific and industrial revolutions as well as the inquisitions. This was also the period during which the Ptolemic world view was challenged and a heliocentric model was developed.</p>

<h3 class="wmd-title" id="ren√©e-descartes-rationalist-view">Ren√©e Descartes - Rationalist view</h3>

<p>Descartes was a mathematician first and foremost, and so approaches the topic from the view of fundemental truths, of methodical doubts. Descartes wants to find knowledge that we know for certain is true.</p>

<h3 class="wmd-title" id="john-locke-empiricist-view">John Locke - Empiricist view</h3>

<p>Locke was a biologist and a physician, and so approaches the topic from the view of the mind or brain, of the physical and tangible, and the role of the senses. Locke wants to determine how the senses fit into the obtaining of knowledge.</p>

<h3 class="wmd-title" id="george-berkeley-empiricist/idealist-view">George Berkeley - Empiricist/Idealist view</h3>

<p>Berkeley was a bishop, and so approaches the topic from the view of the intangible. He is mostly in agreement with Locke, but figures that only ideas exist, and that everything is an idea.</p>

<h1 class="wmd-title" id="1/10/13">1/10/13</h1>

<h2 class="wmd-title" id="descartes">Descartes</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>How do I know what is going on in my mind is like what is in the world?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lived in 1500s. An important scholar in many fields, created the beginnings of analytical geometry, joining geometry and math, Cartesian plane, etc. Contemporary of Galileo. Lived in Netherlands for most of his life.</p>

<p>Proponent of <strong>foundationalism</strong> - epistemological stance searching for certain knowledge to be used as a base to build up a set of solid beliefs. Tracing back all knowledge to facts that are known for certain.</p>

<p>Foundationalism is independent from rationalism vs. empiricism - there can be rationalist foundationalists and rationalist empiricists.</p>

<p><strong>Rationalism</strong> is the view that all knowledge is based on reason/logic alone. Often contrasted with <strong>empiricism</strong> - the view that all knowledge is based on the senses/observations. For example, we know <span class="MathJax_Preview"></span><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-776-Frame" role="textbox" aria-readonly="true" style=""><nobr><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-8915" style="width: 5.252em; display: inline-block;"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 3.953em; height: 0px; font-size: 132%;"><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1.301em 1000.003em 2.438em -0.43em); top: -2.162em; left: 0.003em;"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-8916"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-8917" style="font-family: MathJax_Main;">2</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-8918" style="font-family: MathJax_Main; padding-left: 0.219em;">+</span><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-8919" style="font-family: MathJax_Main; padding-left: 0.219em;">2</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-8920" style="font-family: MathJax_Main; padding-left: 0.273em;">=</span><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-8921" style="font-family: MathJax_Main; padding-left: 0.273em;">4</span></span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 2.167em;"></span></span></span><span style="border-left-width: 0.004em; border-left-style: solid; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: 0px; height: 1.146em; vertical-align: -0.211em;"></span></span></nobr></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-776">2 + 2 = 4</script> through reason, not by seeing two things being combined to yield 4.</p>

<p>Empiricism is reminiscent of Aristotle's view on observations being the source of knowledge. Modern science is also aligned to empirical views.</p>

<p><strong>Realism</strong> is the view that there is a reality outside of the mind, and that there is some sort of correlation between what is in the mind and what is outside of it.</p>

<p><strong>Skepticism</strong> is the view that doubts this possibility, though they may not believe it is false.</p>

<p><strong>Pirrhonian skepticism</strong> is skepticism with a point in mind - not doubting for the sake of doubting. Skepticism is simply the doubting of knowledge. It follows two rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>Acceptance of appearances qua appearances - what is presented before the mind must be accepted; it cannot be doubted what a person thinks they are thinking of. If someone says they saw a ghost, it must be accepted that they think they saw a ghost. There is first person authority - one is the authority on what oneself thinks.</li>
<li>A method of opposition. Either stating that the world doesn't actually exist, or that there is an alternative explanation for what they think. If someone says they saw a ghost, a Pirrhonian skeptic might say it was a man with a sheet, or that the world does not exist for ghosts to be seen in.</li>
</ul>

<p>Descartes wants to be a realist - to have what he sees in his mind be the same as what is out there. To do this, it is necessary to test everything he knows.</p>

<p>This is done through <strong>methodical doubt</strong> - using skepticism to find at least one belief that cannot be doubted. When a belief cannot be doubted, it must be true.</p>

<p>Descartes is a <strong>dualist</strong> - he believes there are two types of substances in the world:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>material</strong> (things with time and space) - "res extensa" - extended in space and time.</li>
<li><strong>immaterial</strong> (souls, minds, ideas) - "res cogitans" - not part of space and time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Descartes' meditations present the issue from the view of the realist and the skeptic. The realist presents beliefs, and the skeptic attempts to doubt them.</p>

<p>Descartes broke up all his beliefs into categories to be able to get through them all.</p>

<h1 class="wmd-title" id="3/10/13">3/10/13</h1>

<p>The first skeptical attack <strong>doubts the senses</strong>. He states that senses have deceived him in the past without his knowing, and if something has deceived him, he should not trust them in the future. How do we know we can trust our senses?</p>

<p>The realist response states that it is <strong>possible to tell the difference</strong> when one is being deceived by the senses, and in <strong>ideal conditions</strong> the senses do not deceive.</p>

<p>The second skeptical attack <strong>doubts his own sanity</strong>. He states that a mental illness could cause false perceptions.</p>

<p>The realist response is that this <strong>breaks the rules of Pirrhonian skepticism</strong> - that appearances should be accepted for appearances. In other words, he can distinguish his perceptions of himself from those of the insane.</p>

<p>The third skeptical attack <strong>doubts whether he is dreaming or awake</strong>. He states that he has previously had dreams that appeared as real as reality while dreaming, and that he cannot be sure whether he is dreaming at this instant.</p>

<p>The realist response is that dreams are <strong>paintings of reality</strong> - there must exist a reality for dreams to reflect. In other words, there must be a world in order to have dreams. Descartes assumes that there are no innate ideas.</p>

<p>Sub-argument counterpoint: to continue the analogy, abstract paintings would not be inspired by reality. In response, the realist response is that there are things like quantity, shape, and color that are also inspired by reality.</p>

<p>So now the skeptic has convinced the realist that a reality doesn't need to exist to have a dream. However, the skeptic has not yet convinced the realist that numbers, shape, etc. are not from reality.</p>

<p>The fourth skeptical attack considers that there is a <strong>possiblity that there is an all powerful, evil being that is actively deceiving him</strong>. For example, the evil being could make every calculation mechanism make <span class="MathJax_Preview"></span><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-777-Frame" role="textbox" aria-readonly="true" style=""><nobr><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-8922" style="width: 5.252em; display: inline-block;"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 3.953em; height: 0px; font-size: 132%;"><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1.356em 1000.003em 2.438em -0.43em); top: -2.162em; left: 0.003em;"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-8923"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-8924" style="font-family: MathJax_Main;">2</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-8925" style="font-family: MathJax_Main; padding-left: 0.219em;">+</span><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-8926" style="font-family: MathJax_Main; padding-left: 0.219em;">2</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-8927" style="font-family: MathJax_Main; padding-left: 0.273em;">=</span><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-8928" style="font-family: MathJax_Main; padding-left: 0.273em;">5</span></span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 2.167em;"></span></span></span><span style="border-left-width: 0.004em; border-left-style: solid; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: 0px; height: 1.146em; vertical-align: -0.211em;"></span></span></nobr></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-777">2 + 2 = 5</script>, and manipulate all of the rest of mathematics to make everything consistent.</p>

<p>The realist has no response to this, and finds the best course for action is to doubt everything.</p>

<p>In summary, the four arguments are the doubt of senses, doubt of sanity, doubt of being awake, and the evil genius.</p>

<p>In the next meditation, Descartes finds a realist response for the last argument:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cogito ergo sum.</p>
  
  <p>I think, therefore I am.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>I think.
If I think, I am.
-----------------
I am.
</code></pre>

<p>The argument states that Descartes knows that he thinks, and that a thinking thing must exist. Therefore, Descartes knows that he exists.</p>

<p>However, this does not prove that he has a body, just a mind. Also, he still does not know that the world exists. He also does not know that any other thoughts in his mind are true. In other words, Descartes has proven the existance of the <strong>immaterial</strong>.</p>

<pre><code>I eat.
If I eat, I am.
---------------
I am.
</code></pre>

<p>This is also a valid argument, but we can't say it is sound since we can't verify whether we are actually eating. However, one can think they are eating, in which case they exist. In this case though, the driving force is still thinking.</p>

<p>There are a few problems here.</p>

<p>The first is the <strong>mind-body problem</strong>. If minds and bodies are immaterial and material, how do they interact? Ideas and matter should not interact. But we observe that they interact all the time.</p>

<p>The second would be the <strong>problem of other minds</strong>. How do we know what is happenning in other minds, or that they even exist? This leads to solipsism - the view that the self is the only mind in the universe, and that everything is a figment of the imagination.</p></div>
