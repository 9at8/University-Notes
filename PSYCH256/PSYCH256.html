<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Cognitive science is the study of the mind and intelligence, with a particular focus on what actually constitutes intelligence and how those things are assembled and used to exhibit intelligent behaviour. This course gives the history and context surrounding this field, with a focus on classical cognitive science, and then presents a wide view of the work that's building on top of this foundation.</p>
<p>Cognitive science can be thought of as a framework for <strong>composing theories about how the mind works</strong>, as well as a set of accumulated <strong>practices and methods for testing these theories</strong>. It's a paradigm in the same sense of paradigms in Kuhn's &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot;.</p>
<p>The defining feature of <strong>classical cognitive science</strong> (circa 1950-1980) is that <strong>thinking is conceptually similar to computation</strong> - intelligence is built on <strong>mental manipulation</strong> of <strong>mental representations</strong>, just like computation is built on symbolic manipulation of symbolic representations. In the classical cognitive science paradigm, researchers investigate intelligent behaviours, compose theories about mental representations/manipulation, and test theories using computer simulations of models (this is known as <strong>cognitive modelling</strong>) and various other experimental methods.</p>
<p>However, these classical theories have had a lot of trouble explaining many of the cognitive phenomena we observe, such as the origin of consciousness, emotions, and so on. Additionally, experimental evidence suggests that the brain doesn't actually seem to be doing anything like symbolic processing, at least at first glance.</p>
<p>First, though: what is intelligence? Colloquial use of the word tells us that intelligent behaviour is based on reason, predictive ability, engineering skill, or some other common things that humans tend to be good at. For this course, we'll be using a more precise definition: <strong>intelligence is the ability to use knowledge or expertise</strong>. Note that this relies heavily on the definition of knowledge - for example, under some interpretations, one might consider a textbook intelligent.</p>
<p>Here's an example of a theory in classical cognitive science: mental representations are the sets of statements about objects (this includes objects in the world, as well as abstract objects like numbers), and mental procedures are a set of rules that a mind can follow to achieve certain outcomes. Under classical cognitive science, we would test this theory by writing computer programs that replicate this, and try to see if we can get them to exhibit intelligence.</p>
<p>Another example of a theory would be: mental representations of human faces are stored in so-and-so location in the human brain. Under classical cognitive science, we would test this theory by performing brain scans while people are recognizing faces in photographs.</p>
<p>The <strong>CRUM</strong> (Computational Representational Understanding of Mind) paradigm is another name for the central ideas of classical cognitive science - that thinking is like computation, that intelligence is defined in terms of knowledge, and that intelligence can be tested for with computational models and various other known methods.</p>
<h3 id="history">History</h3>
<p>Cognitive science asks many of the same questions we see in epistemology, metaphysics, and psychology, but answers them in very different ways.</p>
<p>According to Plato (~400 B.C.E.), one of the earliest western philosophers, thinking is the interaction between the mental organs (both the physical and the immortal, intangible parts) through organic fluids, as a hydraulic system, and knowledge is simply the mind's grasp of true, abstract ideas.</p>
<p>According to Locke (~1690s), one of the most famous early empiricists, thinking is any process of reflection that abstracts ideas from sensations/perception, and knowledge is a set of propositions rooted entirely in sensory experience.</p>
<p>According to the <strong>behaviourist</strong> model of the mind (~1920s), we can't make any scientific claims about knowledge, minds, or thinking. Basically, under this view we treat the mind as a black box, running on top of meat exchanging signals via chemical and electrical phenomena.</p>
<p>According to Wiener (~1940s), a proponent of the <strong>cybernetics</strong> model of the mind, thinking is the process of adapting future behaviour based on the results of past behaviour. Although this has fallen out of favour in most mind-related fields today, it formed the basis for control theory and a variety of fields used in robotics.</p>
<p>Around the same time as Wiener's theories, electronic computers were invented, and with it, significant advances in computational theory. For the first time, people saw machines doing a lot of the things previously only ever done by humans. This, along with several new discoveries (e.g., discovery of short term memory, invention of automated theorem provers, and Chomski-esque linguistics), essentially kicked off what would eventually become CRUM.</p>
