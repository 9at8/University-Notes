**NOTE:** The professor asked the class not to share any notes for this course, so this document just contains summaries of the topics covered in each lecture, as well as any additional resources I acquire outside of the course. That said, if you'd like a specific thing explained, I'm likely to give it a try if you [email me](mailto:azhang9@gmail.com?subject=CS454).

Lecture summary: course administrative information, what a distributed system is exactly, ten common fallacies of distributed systems.

Course has 4 assignments (worth 50%), no midterms, and one final (worth 50%). Textbook "Distributed Systems: Principles and Paradigms (2nd edition)" is freely available online from the publisher ([download page](https://www.distributed-systems.net/index.php/books/distributed-systems/)), though it's not strictly required.

After an assignment deadline, there is a 48 hour grace period afterwards in which instructors won't answer questions on Piazza, but you can still submit your assignment with no penalty.
