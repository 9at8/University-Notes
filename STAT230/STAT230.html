<h1 id="section">5/5/14</h1>
<p>There are two tests and five online quizzes on MapleTA</p>
<p>;wip: there is a test date conflict, email the riley guy mentioned on the course outline</p>
<p>;wip: look at the schedule and put it on the calendar</p>
<p>Probability is a tool used to model uncertainty and variability, like size, weight, and height. It allows us to work with uncertainty, though it cannot eliminate it.</p>
<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>
<p>We first specify the <strong>outcome/event</strong> that we are interested in that might occur in a particular setting. This setting is the <strong>experiment/process</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, rolling a 2 on a 6-sided die has an outcoem of 2 and rolling the die is the experiment.</p>
<p>The <strong>sample space</strong> is the set of all possible outcomes. For example, the die has a sample set of <span class="math">\(S = \set{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\)</span>. We usually represent the sample space as <span class="math">\(S\)</span>.</p>
<p>The <strong>classical definition</strong> of the probability of an event is the ratio of the number of ways the event can occur to the total number of outcomes in <span class="math">\(S\)</span>.</p>
<p>However, this only works if all outcomes are equally likely to occur. In practice, this is not always the case.</p>
<p>The <strong>relative frequency definition</strong> of the probability of an event is the fraction of times when the event occurs when we repeat the experiment a large number of times.</p>
<p>For example, if we toss a coin a large number of times, the fraction approaches 50%. However, we cannot always repeat the experiment due to time and other constraints. Additionally, we have to keep the setting exactly the same.</p>
<p>We generally mean that we repeat the experiment an infinite number of times. In practice, we often settle for a lot less.</p>
<p>The <strong>subjective definition</strong> of the probability of an event is the confidence of the person making the statement that the event will occur. Often, this is based on the person's experiences.</p>
<h3 id="probability-model">Probability model</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Identify the experiment and the events of interest.</li>
<li>Define the sample space <span class="math">\(S\)</span> of the random experiment.</li>
<li>Define the subset of the sample space to which we can assign probabilities.</li>
<li>Assign the probabilities to events somehow.</li>
</ol>
<p>A <strong>discrete sample space</strong> is one where there is a finite number of simple events.</p>
<p>A <strong>simple event</strong> is an event that is made up of only one outcome, synonymous with outcome, like rolling a die and getting 2.</p>
<p>A <strong>compound event</strong> is an event made up of more than one outcome, like rolling a die and getting an even number (outcomes 2, 4, and 6 trigger the event).</p>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(S = \set{a_1, \ldots, a_n}\)</span>. Let <span class="math">\(P(a_i)\)</span> be the probability of the outcome <span class="math">\(a_i\)</span> taking place. Then <span class="math">\(0 \le P(a_i) \le 1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\sum_{i = 1}^n P(a_i) = 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>The function <span class="math">\(P(x)\)</span> is the <strong>probability distribution</strong> on <span class="math">\(S\)</span>.</p>
<p>For a die, <span class="math">\(P(a_i) = \frac 1 6\)</span>.</p>
<p>When we write <span class="math">\(P(a, b, c)\)</span>, we mean the probability of either <span class="math">\(a\)</span>, <span class="math">\(b\)</span>, or <span class="math">\(c\)</span> occurring.</p>
<p>The <strong>odds</strong> of an event <span class="math">\(x\)</span> occurring is <span class="math">\(\frac{P(x)}{1 - P(x)}\)</span>. So odds of 3:1 is a 25% probability. To convert odds like <span class="math">\(a\)</span>:<span class="math">\(b\)</span> to a probability, we simply do <span class="math">\(P(x) = \frac b {a + b}\)</span>.</p>
<h1 id="section-1">7/5/14</h1>
<p>;wip: do the mapleta stuff on LEARN</p>
<p>If we toss a coin twice, what is the probability of getting exactly one heads?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clearly, <span class="math">\(S = \set{(Tails, Tails), (Tails, Heads), (Heads, Tails}, (Heads, Heads)\)</span>. Let <span class="math">\(A\)</span> be the event of getting one heads.<br />Clearly, each outcome is equally likely, so occurs 25% of the time.<br />We care about two of the outcomes, <span class="math">\((Tails, Heads)\)</span> and <span class="math">\((Heads, Tails)\)</span>.<br />So the probability of exactly one heads is <span class="math">\(P(A) = \frac{Event Outcomes}{Total Outcomes} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}\)</span>.<br />Alternatively, if we were to use <span class="math">\(S = \set{0 Heads, 1 Heads, 2 Heads}\)</span>, each outcome would no longer be equally likely - it would be a mistake to say the probability is <span class="math">\(\frac{1}{3}\)</span>.<br />Essentially, we found the probability <span class="math">\(P(A) = P((Tails, Heads)) + P(Heads, Tails)\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is the probability that the sum of two dice rolls is 5?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clearly, there are <span class="math">\(6 \times 6 = 36\)</span> possible outcomes, all equally likely. Basically, <span class="math">\(S = \set{(1, 1), \ldots, (6, 6)}\)</span>. Let <span class="math">\(A\)</span> represent the event of the sum being 5.<br />Clearly, the combinations resulting in a total of 5 are <span class="math">\((1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1)\)</span>.<br />Since there are 4 outcomes, <span class="math">\(P(A) = \frac{4}{36} = \frac{1}{9}\)</span>.<br />If two indistinguishable dice were used, then we could no longer tell which die was which. Since the pairs in <span class="math">\(S\)</span> are no longer ordered, we remove the duplicates to obtain 21 possibilities. However, they now do not all have the same probability of occurring - <span class="math">\((2, 2)\)</span> is only half as likely as <span class="math">\((1, 2)\)</span> since <span class="math">\((1, 2) = (2, 1)\)</span> when the dice are indistinguishable.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="counting-techniques">Counting Techniques</h2>
<p>When there are <span class="math">\(n\)</span> outcomes that are all equally likely, then the probability of each outcome is <span class="math">\(\frac{1}{n}\)</span>.</p>
<p>If job A can be done in P ways and job B can be done in Q ways, then we can do either job A or job B in <span class="math">\(P + Q\)</span> ways. Here, &quot;or&quot; becomes addition. For example, the probabiity of getting heads or tails is <span class="math">\(P(Heads) + P(Heads) = \frac 1 2 + \frac 1 2 = 1\)</span></p>
<p>If job A can be done in P ways, and for each of those P ways, job B can be done in Q distinct ways, then we can do both job A and B in <span class="math">\(p \times q\)</span> ways. For example, <span class="math">\(P((Heads, Heads)) = P(Heads) AND P(Heads) = \frac 1 2 \times \frac 1 2 = \frac{1}{4}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Sampling <strong>with replacement</strong> means that every time we select an object for sampling, we simply put it back into the population, so we could potentially sample it again.</p>
<p>This means that what we get on each selection will not affect subsequent selections. For example, a coin flip has both sides of the coin replaced after each sample, so there is always the same probability of getting heads or tails.</p>
<p>Sampling <strong>without replacement</strong> means that after selecting an object, we do not put it back. Therefore, an object can only be selected at most once.</p>
<p>This means that what we get on each selection will influence sebsequent selections and is influenced by previous selections. For example, sampling genders of students from a classroom without replacement results in a different probabilities of choosing a certain gender.</p>
<p>Sampling without replacement has a big effect on small samples, but for larger samples its effect becomes negligible.</p>
<p>Many problems have sample spaces that are a set of arrangements - permutations. <span class="math">\(n^{(r)} = \frac{n!}{(n - r)!}\)</span> means &quot;<span class="math">\(n\)</span> to <span class="math">\(r\)</span> factors&quot;. ;wip: nPr notation</p>
<p>For example, consider a set of 20 people's birthdays:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clearly, <span class="math">\(S\)</span> is a set containing 20 dates (each one of 365 days), so there are <span class="math">\(365^{20}\)</span> outcomes.<br />What is the probability of everyone having a different birthdays? Clearly, everyone has a different birthday if and only if the ordered birthdays are a 20-permutation of <span class="math">\([365]\)</span>. This is because the 20-permutations account for all possible sequence of <span class="math">\([365]\)</span> where all the dates are unique.<br />Therefore, there are <span class="math">\(365^{(20)}\)</span> possible outcomes, and since they are all equally likely, the probability is <span class="math">\(\frac{365^{(20)}}{365^{20}} \approxeq 59%\)</span>.</p>
