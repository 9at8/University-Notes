Most materials will be on LEARN. Questions and answers can be posted on Piazza.

Study of the design and the analsis of algorithms - in particular, the correctness (proved via formal proofs) and efficiency (proved using time complexity analysis).

Useful metrics for algorithms are asymptotic complexity (best case/average case/worst case time/space complexity), number of specific computations used (like comparisons in sorting algorithms), whether an algorithm is the most efficient for a particular problem, etc.

Interesting things to know are lower bounds on possible algorithms to solve a particular problems, problems that cannot be solved by any algorithm (undecidability), and problems that cannot be solved efficiently by any algorithm, but can be solved (NP-hardness).

Useful design strategies we will go over are divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, breadth-first and depth-first search, local search, and linear programming.

An example of an algorithm design is the maximum problem: given an array of integers $A$, find the maximum integer in $A$. A simple solution to this is as follows:

    def find_max(array):
        current = array[0]
        for elem in array[1:]:
            if elem > current: current = elem
        return elem

This seems to be obviously correct, but we can also use program verification to prove it correct. In this case, we will use induction to prove the loop invariant - at the end of each iteration of the loop, `current` is equal to the largest element encountered so far in the array. We'd check the base case for arrays of length 1, then prove the inductive hypothesis to formally verify the program.


Clearly, this algorithm is $\Theta(n)$, since it loops over the entire array once. Formal time complexity analysis can also be done by noting that the loop body takes $\Theta(1)$ time, and the loop runs $\Theta(n)$ times.

We also know that this algorithm is asymptotically optimal, at least in terms of the number of comparisons done. Since a correct solution to the Maximum problem must look at every element in the array, it must therefore do at least $n - 1$ comparisons. Since each comparison takes $\Theta(1)$ time, the best possible algorithm must take $\Omega(n)$ time. Let's formally prove this:

> Suppose there was an algorithm that could determine the maximum element of an array using fewer than $n - 1$ comparisons.  
> Let $G$ be a graph such that each vertex in $G$ corresponds to an element in $A$, and each comparison done by a run of the algorithm between any two elements results in an edge between those two elements.  
> Clearly, there are $n - 2$ edges or less, and $n$ vertices.  
> Therefore, there are at least 2 components in $G$, since the graph cannot be connected.  
> Clearly, the solution could be in any of the components, and can only be found by comparing them.  
> Therefore, the algorithm cannot exist.  

An algorithm to find the minimum and the maximum element of an array can also trivially be designed, using $2n - 2$ comparisons and $\Theta(n)$ time. However, it is possible to design another algorithm that does fewer than $2n - 2$ comparisons (though the time complexity might be worse).

One way to do this is to consider elements two at a time - we compare elements one pair at a time, the larger of the pair with the maximum, and the smaller of which with the minimum. That means we need 3 comparisons per pair, or $\ceil{\frac 3 2 n} - 2$ in total, a ~25% improvement:

    def find_min_max(array):
        if array[0] < array[1]: min, max = array[0], array[1]
        else: max, min = array[0], array[1
        for i in range(2, len(array), 2):
            if array[i] < array[i + 1]: small, big = array[i], array[i + 1]
            else: big, small = array[i], array[i + 1]
            if big > max: max = big
            if small < min: min = small
        if len(array) % 2:
            if array[-1] > max: max = array[-1]
            if array[-1] < min: min = array[-1]

It can actually be proven, using graph theory, that the number of comparisons for this algorithm is optimal. However, it's too lengthy and complicated to cover here.

Suppose we want to determine whether and which three elements of an array of integers sum to 0. This is pretty easy to do in $O(n^3)$ (specifically, $n \choose 3$ runs of the inner loop) simply by checking all possible triples in the array. Basically, we pick two elements $A[i]$ and $A[j]$, then try to search for a $A[k] = -(A[i] + A[j])$ using linear search. However, it is actually possible to do so in $O(n^2 \log n)$ by sorting the array first, and searching for $k$ using binary search instead.

In fact, it's possible to do even better by sorting the array, taking each $A[i]$, and searching from both ends of the array inward for $j$ and $k$ such that $A[j] + A[k] = -A[i]$. After each step in the search, we either move inward from the left if $A[j] + A[k] < -A[i]$, or inward from the right if $A[j] + A[k] > -A[i]$

# 16/9/15

The pseudocode for the above algorithm looks like the following:

    def better_3sum(array):
        array = sorted(array)
        result = []
        for i in range(n - 2):
            j, k = i + 1, n
            while j < k:
                triple_sum = array[i] + array[j] + array[k]
                if triple_sum < 0: j += 1
                elif triple_sum > 0: k -= 1
                else:
                    result.append((i, j, k))
                    j += 1
                    k -= 1

Basically, this goes through each value of $i$, and does an $O(n)$ search for two values that would make it possible to have all three sum to 0. Proving this correct is left as an exercise to the reader - prove that $k - j$ is monotonically decreasing, and the pairs cover all possible pairs that can possibly sum up to $A[i]$. It's somewhat reminiscent of the array merge in merge sort.

This algorithm is $O(n^2)$, since the search is $O(n^2)$ and the sort is $O(n \log n)$. There are actually even better algorithms, and the best currently known ones are $O\left(n^2 \left(\frac{\log \log n}{\log n}\right)^2\right)$.

A **problem** is a computational task. A **problem instance** is the input for the computational task. The **problem solution** is the output. The **size of a problem instance** is a positive integer that is a measure of the size of the instance, and depends on the problem itself. The size is usually fairly intuitive, such as the size of an array for array sum, but sometimes it gets a bit more tricky.

An **algorithm** is a high level description of a computation. An algorithm **solves** a problem if it finds a valid solution for any instance in finite time. A **program** is an implementation of an algorithm using a computer language.

Time Complexity Analysis
------------------------

The running time of a program $M$ for a problem instance $I$ is $T_M(I)$. The worst case running time for problem instances of size $n$ for the program is $T_M(n)$. The average case running time is $T_M^{avg}(n)$.

The **worst case time complexity** of an algorithm $A$ is $f(n)$ such that a program $M$ exists implementing $A$ such that $T_M(n) \in \Theta(f(n))$.

Running time can only be found by running the program on a computer. Complexity is independent, but we lose information such as the constant factors.

To get the time complexity of an algorithm, we can either use $\Theta(f(n))$ throughout our analysis, or prove $O(f(n))$ and then $\Omega(f(n))$, which is often easier due to being able to make more assumptions for each separate proof.

The complexity of a loop in code is sum of the complexity of its body over each iteration of the loop. The complexity of consecutive operations is the sum of the complexities of the operations they are composed of.

Prove that $(\ln n)^a \in o(n^b)$ for any $a$ and $b$:

> Let $L = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{(\ln n)^a}{n^b} \lH \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{a (\ln n)^{a - 1}}{b n^b} \lH \ldots \lH \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{a!}{b^a n^b} = 0$.  
> By the limit order rule, $(\ln n)^a \in o(n^b)$.

Useful to know:

* $\sum_{i = 0}^{n - 1} (a + di) = na + \frac{dn(n - 1)} 2$ - arithmetic sequence
* $\sum_{i = 0}^{n - 1} ar^i = \begin{cases}
a\frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1} &\text{if } r > 1 \\
na &\text{if } r = 1 \\
a\frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} &\text{if } r < 1 \\
\end{cases}$ - geometric sequence
* $\sum_{i = 0}^{n - 1} (a + di)r^i = \frac a {1 - r} - \frac{(a + (n - 1)d)r^n}{1 - r} + \frac{dr(1 - r^{n - 1})}{(1 - r)^2}$ -arithmetic-geometric sequence
* $\sum_{i = 1}^n \frac 1 {i^2} = \frac{\pi^2} 6 = \Theta(1)$
* $_n = \sum_{i = 1}^n \frac 1 i \in \Theta(\log n)$ - harmonic sequence

The order of $n!$ is $\Theta(n^2 \sqrt n e^{-n})$. This is similar to Striling's approximation, $\sqrt{2 \pi n} n^n e^{-n}$ (this gets more and more accurate for larger values).

For order notation, the base of logarithmic terms don't matter because $\log n = \frac 1 {\log_b 10} \log_b n$, and $\frac 1 {\log_b 10}$ is a constant factor.

**Polynomial growth rates** are those in $O(n^k), k \in \mb{R}$. For example, the best known algorithm for graph isomorphism is $n^{\sqrt n \log_2 n}$, so it is not polynomial.

# 23/9/15

Consider the following program:

```python
def useless(n):
    for i in range(n):
        while j >= 1:
            j /= 2
```

Clearly, each iteration of the inner loop will run $\Theta(\log n)$ times, so the overall time complexity is $\sum_{i = 1}^n \Theta(\log i) = \Theta(\sum_{i = 1}^n \log i) = \Theta(\log(\prod_{i = 1}^n i)) = \Theta(\log(n!)) = \Theta(n \log n)$.

A **recurrence relation** specifies $a_n$ in the infinite sequence of real numbers $a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots$ in terms of the previous terms $a_1, \ldots, a_{n - 1}$ ($a_1$ must therefore be a constant - the **initial value**). A **solution** to a recurrence relation is a closed form formula for $a_n$ - one that does not depend on the previous values of $a_1, \ldots, a_{n - 1}$. These are generally solved using techniques like guess and check or recursion trees, but there aren't any methods that are guaranteed to solve all recurrences, and in fact, reurrences may not necessarily even have solutions.

Recurrence relations can also be written using function notation, like $T(1) = 2, T(n) = T(n - 1) + 1$.

The **guess and check** method involves computing enough $a_n$ instances to guess the form of the solution (without any constants). Then, we solve for the constants using the computed values, and check if our solution is correct - if it is, we must prove it is correct using induction, and if not, we start over with a different guess.

Solve $a_0 = 4, a_n = a_{n - 1} + 6n - 5$:

> Guess and check: the first few elements of the sequence are $a_0 = 4, a_1 = 5, a_2 = 12, a_3 = 25, a_4 = 44$.  
> This seems to be quadratic growth, so we guess $an^2 + bn + c, a, b, c \in \mb{R}$ as the solution.  
> Solving for $a, b, c$, $c = 4, a + b + c = 5, 4a + 2b + c = 12$, we get $a = 3, b = -2, c = 4$.  
> So we guess that $a_n = 3n^2 - 2n + 4$. We can verify this for $0 \le n \le 4$ as our inductive base case.  
> Assume for some $k \in \mb{N}$ that $a_k = 3k^2 - 2k + 4$.  
> Clearly, $a_{k + 1} = 3k^2 - 2k + 4 + 6(k + 1) - 5 = 3(k + 1)^2 - 2(k + 1) + 4$.  
> So by induction, $a_n = 3n^2 - 2n + 4$.  

The **recurrence tree** method is often used for divide-and-conquer algorithms. This technique involves building a call tree for the recurrence. then summing up the results of the function on each level of the tree.

To construct a recurrence tree, we start with the timing function $T(n)$, then add children for each recursive call. The recursive calls are then removed from the parent. This is repeated for the children, all the way until we reah the base case. Note that after each step of growing the tree, the sum of all the nodes are always equivalent to $T(n)$.

Then, we sum the nodes at each level in the tree. The sum of all these sums is equal to $T(n)$.

Use the recurrence tree method to find the running time of merge sort:

> Clearly, $T(n) = \begin{cases}
2T\left(\frac n 2\left) + cn &\text{if } n > 1 \wedge n \text{ is a power of 2} \\
d &\text{if } n = 1 \\
\end{cases}$ where $c, d$ are constants.  
> Construct a recursion tree: start with the root node $N$ with value $T(n)$, then add 2 children, $N_1, N_2$, both $T\left(\frac n 2\left)$, and replace $N$'s value with $cn$.  
> What we get is a binary tree with every internal node having 2 children, and value $c2^i$ (where $i$ is the level in the tree, where 0 is the bottommost level, the leaf nodes), and each leaf node has value $d$.  
> Let $n = 2^j$. Then at the top level each node has value $c2^j$, at the second level $c2^{j - 1}$, at the third level $c2^{j - 2}$, and so on. All leaf nodes must have value $d$, since it is the only base case.  
> Clearly, the height of the tree must then be $j + 1$, with $j$ interior levels. Clearly, at the bottom level there are $2^j$ leaf nodes, since each level $i$ has $2^{j - i}$ nodes. The sum of the bottom level is therefore $2^j d = dn$.  
> Clearly, at each internal level $i$ each node has value $c 2^i$. Since there are $2^{j - i}$ nodes, the sum of each interior level is $c2^{j - i}2^i = c2^j = cn$.  
> So $T(n) = dn + jcn = dn + cn \log_2 n = \Theta(n \log n)$.  

The **master theorem** is a generalized formula for solving certain forms of recurrences. One thing it says is that given $T(n) = aT(\frac n b) + \Theta(n^y)$ where $a \ge 1, b > 1$, and $n$ is a power of $b$, then $T(n) \in \begin{cases}
\Theta(n^x) &\text{if } y < x \\
\Theta(n^x \log n) &\text{if } y = x \\
\Theta(n^y) &\text{if } y > x \\
\end{cases}$ where $x = \log_b a$.

Also, the exact value is $T(n) = da^j + cn^y \sum_{i = 0}^{j - 1} \left(\frac a {b^y}\right)^i$, or more simply $T(n) = dn^x + cn^y \sum_{i = 0}^{j - 1} r^i$ where $x = \log_b a$ and $r = \frac a {b^y} = b^{x - y}$.

This can be proved by constructing tree, figuring out the geometric sequence for the tree sums, and then solving for its value for each of the three cases.

A more general version, which will not be proved here, is that given $T(n) = aT(\frac n b) + f(n)$ where $a \ge 1, b > 1$, and $n$ is a power of $b$, then $T(n) \in \begin{cases}
\Theta(n^x) &\text{if } f(n) \in O(n^{x - \epsilon}) \text{ for some } \epsilon > 0 \\
\Theta(n^x \log n) &\text{if } f(n) \in O(n^x) \\
\Theta(f(n)) &\text{if } \frac{f(n)}{n^{x + \epsilon}} \text{ is an incresing function of } n \text{ for some } \epsilon > 0 \\
\end{cases}$ where $x = \log_b a$.

# 28/9/15

Solve $T(1) = 1, T(n) = 3T(\frac n 4) + n \log n$:

> Let $a = 3, b = 4, f(n) = n \log n$, so $x = \log_4 3$ and $f(n) / n^{x + \epsilon}$  is an increasing function of $n$ for $\epsilon = 1 - \log_4 3$ since $f(n) / n^{x + \epsilon} = \log n$.  
> So $T(n) \in \Theta(n \log n)$.  

The main task when using the master theorem to prove time complexities is choosing the right $\epsilon$ to make one of the cases valid. For example, the master theorem cannot be used for something like $T(1) = 1, T(n) = 2T(\frac n 2) + n \log n$, since none of the cases apply. Instead, we can use the recurrence tree method to solve the recurrence directly:

> Each level $i$ (from the bottom) of the tree has $2^i$ nodes, each with value $2^{j - i}(j - i)$ where $n = 2^j$.  
> So at each level, the sum is $2^i 2^{j - i} (j - i) = (j - i) 2^j$.  
> So the sum of the tree is $\sum_{i = 0}^j (j - i) 2^j = j^2 2^j - 2^j \sum_{i = 0}^j i = 2^j\left(j^2 - \frac{j(j + 1)}{2}\right) = \Theta(n \log^2 n)$.  

Divide and Conquer
------------------

Divide and conquer is a design strategy for algorithms where we divide a problem into smaller subproblems, solve those individually, then combine them back together to get a good result. Formally:

* Divide the problem instance $I$ into smaller subproblems $I_1, \ldots, I_n$.
* Solve $I_1, \ldots, I_n$ recursively to get sollutions $S_1, \ldots, S_n$.
* Use $S_1, \ldots, S_n$ to compute $S$ - combine the results. This is usually the hardest step.

For example, mergesort splits an array into two subarrays, and then recursively sorts those. Then, the merge is performed to combine the two sorted subarrays.

The time complexity of this is $T(n) = \begin(cases)
T(\ceil{\frac n 2}) + T(\floor{\frac n 2}) + cn &\text(if } n > 1 \\
d &\text(if } n = 1 \\
\end{cases}$ for some constants $c, d$. This is called the **exact recurrence**. If we remove the ceilings and floors, we get a **sloppy recurrence** $T(n) = \begin(cases)
2T(\frac n 2) + cn &\text(if } n > 1 \\
d &\text(if } n = 1 \\
\end{cases}$, which only works the same when $n$ is a power of 2, but is a lot simpler to work with.

The master theorem can prove that mergesort is $\Theta(n \log n)$ for the sloppy recurrence, and therefore only for when $n$ is a pwoer of 2. However, if we want to get the time complexity for all $n$, we need to use induction on the exact recurrence.

# 30/9/15

### Non-dominated points

Suppose we have a set of 2D coordinates/points. One point **dominates** another if it has a greater or equal X and Y coordinate than the other. We want to find those points that are non-dominated - the points that are not dominated by any other point. The non-dominated points form a sort of boundary below which all the dominated points lie.

Clearly, this can easily be solved simply by checking every pair of points to see which dominate which, but this would take $\Theta(n^2)$ time.

A better solution is to sort the points by their X coordinate, and then apply divide and conquer.

Dividing larger sets of points $S$ is also easy - we can just split the sorted points into two sets $S_1, S_2$, and then recursively solve the problem. It is the combining step that is the difficult step.

Given a point and the highest point on its right, it is easy to determine whether it is dominated. This is our base case

Clearly, no point in $S_1$ can dominate a point in $S_2$, since the X coordinates of points in $S_1$ is strictly less than points in $S_2$. So we find the point in $S_2$ with the highest Y coordinate, and all points in $S_1$ with Y coordinate at or below this value are guaranteed to be dominated by at least one point in $S_2$. In this way, we can eliminate all the points in $S_1$ that are dominated by points in $S_2$ in $O(n)$ time - this is the combining step.

In code, this looks like:

```python
def non_dominated(points):
    points = sorted(points, key=lambda p: p.x)
    if len(points) == 1: return {points[0]}
    pivot = floor(len(points) / 2)
    left = non_dominated(points[:pivot])
    right = non_dominated(points[pivot + 1:])
    while i < len(left) and left[i].y > right[1].y:
        i += 1
```

Clearly, the time complexity of this algorithm is $T(n) = T\left(\floor{\frac n 2}\right) + T\left(\ceil{\frac n 2}\right) = O(n \log n)$ (the sloppy version of this can be proven using the master theorem).

Without divide and conquer, we could also just sort the list, and then iterate though it from right to left, keeping track of the largest Y axis coordinate seen so far and eliminating points at or below this Y coordinate:

```python
def non_dominated(points):
    largest = float("-inf")
    for point in reversed(sorted(points, key=lambda p: p.x)):
        if point.y <= largest:
            yield point
        else:
            largest = point.y
```

### Closest pair

Suppose we have a set $Q$ of $n$ distinct 2D points in Euclidean space. We want to find the two points that are closest together - the points $u, v$ for which $\sqrt{(u_x - v_x)^2 + (u_y - v_y)^2}$ is minimised.

Clearly, minimising $\sqrt{(u_x - v_x)^2 + (u_y - v_y)^2}$ is the same as minimising $(u_x - v_x)^2 + (u_y - v_y)^2$. We will again sort the points in $Q$ by X coordinate, taking $\Theta(n \log n)$ time.

The dividing step is again trivial to get two partitions $Q_1, Q_2$, but the combining step takes some work.

If we are given the distance $\delta$ between the closest pair of points seen so far in the left and right partitions, and a point $p$, we know that if this point is in the closest pair of points, the other point must have X coordinate within $\delta$ of this point's X coordinate. Therefore, the other point must be in the **critical strip** - a section of the plane from $p_x - \delta$ to $p_x + \delta$ and extending infinitely both up and down.

We now want to find the closest pair between the left and right partitions, if it is less than the .

There is also a lemma that says that if a critical strip $R$ of $Q$ is sorted by Y coordinate, and $R[j]$ and $R[k]$ have distance less than $\delta$ where $j < k$, then $k \le j + 7$. Here, $\delta$ is the smaller of the minimum distance between points in $Q_1$, and the minimum distance between points in $Q_2$. This can be proven by dividing the strip around the point as squares of side length $\frac \delta 2$, and then showing that no two points can be in the same square. In other words, within a critical strip and given $\delta$, the point closest to a given point can be determined in 7 comparisons or less.

```python
def closest_pair(points, start, end):
    if start == end: return float("inf")
    pivot = floor((left + right) / 2)
    closest_left = closest_pair(points, left, pivot)
    closest_right = closest_pair(points, pivot + 1, right)
    closest = min(closest_left, closest_right)
    candidates = select_candidates(left, right, closest, points[pivot].x) # find points in the critical strip
    candidates = sorted(candidates, key=lambda p: p.y)
    closest = check_candidates(candidates, closest)
    return closest
```

The time complexity of this is $O(n \log n \log n)$. We can improve this by eliminating the Y coordinate sort of the candidates. One of them is to sort all the points $Q$ by Y coordinate to begin with, and then use that list when checking candidates, and then adding the necessary checks that make it work. Alternatively, we could replace the Y coordinate sort with a merge, and maintaining the candidates in sorted order.

```python
def closest_pair(points, start, end):
    if start == end: return float("inf")
    pivot = floor((left + right) / 2)
    closest_left = closest_pair(points, left, pivot)
    closest_right = closest_pair(points, pivot + 1, right)
    closest = min(closest_left, closest_right)
    merge_in_place(points, start, pivot, end)
    candidates = select_candidates(left, right, closest, points[pivot].x) # find points in the critical strip
    closest = check_candidates(candidates, closest)
    return closest
```

# 5/10/15

The **size** of an integer is the number of bits that we use to represent it, rather than the value of the integer itself - this is basically just $\ceil{\log_2 n}$. The **bit complexity** of algorithms operating on integers is therefore the complexity as a function of the sizes of those integers.

Multiplication
--------------

### Integer multiplication

Suppose we have 2 positive binary integers, $X = [X_{k - 1}, \ldots, X_0]$ and $Y = [Y_{k - 1}, \ldots, Y_0]$. We want to compute the $2k$-bit product $Z = [Z_{2k - 1}, \ldots, Z_0]$. Naively, we can use the simple binary multiplication algorithm, to shift $Y$ by each position $0 \le i < k$ and add those shifted values for which $X_i = 1$, in $O(k^2)$. Note that the fastest way to add two integers is $\Theta(k)$.

We can do better than this by using divide and conquer, by using $XY = (2^{\frac k 2} X_L + X_R)(2^{\frac k 2} Y_L + Y_R) = 2^k X_L Y_L + 2^{\frac k 2}(X_L Y_R + X_R Y_L) + X_R Y_R$, then solving for those four multiplications between $X_L, X_R, Y_L, Y_R$ (multiplying the powers of 2 are simply shifts, so they're basically free):

```python
def multiply(x, y):
    if len(x) == 1: return x[0] * y[0]
    x_left, x_right = x[:len(x) // 2], x[len(x) // 2:]
    y_left, y_right = y[:len(y) // 2], y[len(y) // 2:]
    z_top = multiply(x_left, y_left)
    z_middle = add(multiply(x_left, x_right), multiply(x_right, y_left))
    z_bottom = multiply(x_right, y_right)
    z = add(
        shift_left(z_top, len(x)),
        shift_left(z_middle, len(x) // 2),
        z_bottom
    )
    return z
```

Using the master theorewm, we can show that this is takes $\Theta(n^2)$ time - no improvement over the naive algorithm. However, this is a good base for an improved version.

Consider $(X_L + X_R)(Y_L + Y_R) = X_L Y_L + X_L Y_R + X_R Y_L + X_R Y_R$. So $X_L Y_R + X_R Y_L = (X_L + X_R)(Y_L + Y_R) - X_L Y_L - X_R Y_R$. Since we need to calculate $X_L Y_L$ and $X_R Y_R$ anyways, we can compute $X_L Y_R + X_R Y_L$ with just one multiplication by computing $(X_L + X_R)(Y_L + Y_R)$.

So using this:

```python
def multiply(x, y):
    if len(x) == 1: return x[0] * y[0]
    x_left, x_right = x[:len(x) // 2], x[len(x) // 2:]
    y_left, y_right = y[:len(y) // 2], y[len(y) // 2:]
    z_top = multiply(x_left, y_left)
    z_middle = multiply(add(x_left, x_right), add(y_left, y_right))
    z_bottom = multiply(x_right, y_right)
    z = add(
        shift_left(z_top, len(x)),
        shift_left(z_middle, len(x) // 2) - z_top - z_bottom,
        z_bottom
    )
    return z
```

Now, we only solve 3 subproblems instead of 4. This gives us a time complexity of around $\Theta(k^{\log_2 3})$, or about $\Theta(k^{1.59})$.

Even better algorithms exist. One is Toom-Cook, which splits $X$ and $Y$ into 3 pieces each, and solves 5 subproblems, all in $O(k^{\log_3 5})$. The Stronhage-Strassen method takes $O(k \log \log \log k)$ time, using Fourier transforms. The Furer method is the most advanced as of the present, using $O(k \log k 2^{3 \log^* k})$ time where $\log^* k$ is the inverse Ackermann function.

### Matrix multiplication

We will now assume that integer multiplication can be done in constant time, to avoid having to consider bit complexity.

Suppose we have two $n$ by $n$ matrices $A, B$. Clearly, the naive algorithm for multiplying them is $\Theta(n^3)$, since we just take the dot product of the corresponding row of $A$ and the corresponding column of $B$ - the dot product takes $\Theta(n)$, and there are $\Tehta(n^2)$ cells in the result.

We can use the same technique as for integer multiplcation - we break each $n$ by $n$ matrix into 4 $\frac n 2$ by $\frac n 2$ matrices, multiply those, then combine those together, then again try to remove subproblem calculations where possible.

If we split $A, B$ into 4 blocks $A = \begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix}, B = \begin{bmatrix} e & f \\ g & h \end{bmatrix}$, then $AB = \begin{bmatrix} ae + bg & af + bh \\ ce + dg & cf + dh \end{bmatrix}$. If we use divide and conquer to solve these 8 multiplications in the block version, it still takes $\Theta(n^3)$. However, the problem is now in a form that is useful for optimizing, by reducing the number of sub-problems.

Strassen's method notes that if $P_1 = a(f - h), P_2 = (a + b)h, P_3 = (c + d)e, P_4 = d(g - e), P_5 = (a + d)(e + h), P_6 = (b - d)(g + h), P_7 = (a - c)(e - f)$, then $ae + bg = P_5 + P_4 - P_2 + P_6, af + bh = P_1 + P_2, ce + dg = P_3 + P_4, cf + dh = P_5 + P_1 - P_3 - P_7$.

So $AB = \begin{bmatrix} P_5 + P_4 - P_2 + P_6 & P_1 + P_2 \\ P_3 + P_4 & P_5 + P_1 - P_3 - P_7 \end{bmatrix}$, and since there are only 7 multiplications needed to calculate $P_1, \ldots, P_7$, we only have 7 sub-problems to solve. As a result, the algorithm is $\Theta(n^{\log_2 7})$ or around $\Theta(n^{2.81})$, since the recurrence is $T(n) = 7T\left(\frac n 2\right) + \Theta(n^2)$ (solve this using the master theorem).

Research into this problem has resulted into better algorithms. The current state of the art is the Coppersmith-Winograd algorithm, taking around $O(n^{2.373})$ time.

### Selection

Suppose we have an array $A$ of size $n$, and we want to find the $k$th smallest integer, where the smallest element is found when $k = 1$. The median algorithm is a special case of this where $k = \ceil{\frac n 2}$.

Naively, we could just sort the array and pick the $k$th element, all in $\Theta(n \log n)$ time. Another naive approach is to use a modified selection sort (repeatedly finding the smallest element in the remaining part of the array, and putting it at the end of the sorted array), where we stop after $k$ moves, all in $\Theta(kn)$ time - this is linear if $k$ is constant, but quadratic if it is not. Combining the two, we can use a modified heapsort, which can solve the problem in $\Theta(n + k \log n)$ time.

# 7/10/15

There's a make-up lecture on November 21st or so.

Using divide and conquer, we might do something similar to quicksort, called quickselect - we pick a pivot, partition the elements, and then recursively quickselect within the partition that contains the desired element:

```python
def quickselect(array, k):
    pivot = array[0]
    partition1, partition2 = [x for x in array if x < pivot], [x for x in array if x > pivot]
    if k - 1 == len(partition1):
        return pivot
    elif k - 1 < len(partition1):
        return quickselect(partition1, k)
    else:
        return quickselect(partition2, k - len(partition1) - 1)
```

Note that unlike quicksort, there's only one recursive call in each invocation. On average, the pivot will be good about 50% of the time, where a good pivot is one that is within the 25th and 75th percentile inclusive. So on average, we would expect that every two calls, we would get a good pivot. So on average, every other call would have partitions that are of size at most 75% of the array's size. Therefore, on average the size of the subproblem would be reduced by 25% on every other call, which makes this function $\Theta(n)$ average case.

Note that in the worst case, the pivot would be at one of the extremes of the percentiles, and so the subproblem would only be reduced by a constant amount, and there are $n$ calls. Therefore, the function is $\Theta(n^2)$ worst case.

However, if we could always choose a good pivot, then we can ensure that the function is $\Theta(n)$ worst case as well. Doing so is a bit more clever, but it is possible, using the **median of medians** algorithm. First, we assume that there are at least 15 elements, so $n = 10r + 5 + \theta$, where $r \ge 1, 0 \le \theta \le 9$.

We now split $A$ into subarrays of exactly 5 elements: $B_1, \ldots, B_{2r + 1}$ (we ignore the last $\theta$ elements entirely here), and then find the median of each $B_i$, as $m_i$. Then, we use a selection algorithm to find the median of this array of medians.

We claim that $y$ is always a good pivot - that is is guaranteed to be between the 25th and 75th percentile inclusive. We will prove this later, but first, we will integrate it into quickselect:

```python
def median_of_medians_quickselect(array, k):
    # generate a good pivot
    if len(array) < 15: return sorted(array)[k]
    write $n = 10r + 5 + \theta$
    construct $B_1, \ldots, B_{2r + 1}$
    find medians $M = [m_1, \ldots, m_{2r + 1}]$
    pivot = median_of_medians_quickselect(M, r + 1)
    
    # do the rest of the steps from quickselect
    partition1, partition2 = [x for x in array if x < pivot], [x for x in array if x > pivot]
    if k - 1 == len(partition1):
        return pivot
    elif k - 1 < len(partition1):
        return quickselect(partition1, k)
    else:
        return quickselect(partition2, k - len(partition1) - 1)
```

We have two recursive calls now, since the median of medians algorithm also required us to do a selection to find `pivot` ($y$).

There are $r + 1$ medians at or below $y$ in $m_1, \ldots, m_{2r + 1}$ - let these be represented $m_{i_1}, \ldots, m_{i_{r + 1}}$. Clearly, in each $B_{i_1}, \ldots, B_{i_{r + 1}}$, there are at least 3 out of the 5 elements that are less than $y$ (since they are less than the median). Therefore, there must be at least $3(r + 1)$ elements that are less than $y$. Since there are $10r + 5$ elements (since we ignored $\theta$), the ratio of elements below $y$ to the total number of elements is $\frac{3(r + 1)}{10r + 5}$, or basically $\frac 3 {10}$. Therefore, 30% or more of the elements must be less than or equal to $y$.

Using a similar argument, but with the elements at or above $y$ rather than at or below, we can prove that 30% or more of the elements must be greater or equal to $y$. Therefore, $y$ is within the 30th to 70th percentile inclusive.

Therefore, the sloppy recurrence is $T(n) \le T(\frac n 5) + T(\frac{7n}{10}) + \Theta(n)$, which we can solve using the recurrence tree method - each node has two children, which are the node's value times $\frac 1 5$ and $\frac 7 {10}$, respectively, and the root node's value is $n$. When we draw the tree, we see that each level $i$ from the root (level 0) has sum $(\frac 9 {10}\right)^in$, and the sum of all levels to infinity converges to $10n$, so $T(n) \in \Theta(n)$.

The exact recurrence for this is $T(n) \le T(\floor{\frac n 5}) + T(\floor{\frac{7n + 12}{10}}) + \Theta(n)$. This accounts for the rounding down in the partitioning, and accounts for the last $\theta$ values we were ignoring earlier.

Greedy Algorithms
-----------------

Greedy algorithms are often used for **optimization problems**, which are problems where the goal is to find a solution that both satisfies the **problem constraints**, and maximizes/minimizes an **objective/profit/cost function**.

**Feasible solutions** are those that satisfy the problem constraints, and given a problem instance $I$, are represented as $\mathrm{feasible}(I)$. The objective function is in $\mathrm{feasible}(I) \to \mb{R}$.

For greedy algorithms, it is generally the proof of correctness that is the hard part. Greedy algorithms build up partial solutions, making locally optimal decisions at each step, with the goal of getting a globally optimal result.

A feasible solution should be writeable as an $n$-tuple $\tup{x_1, \ldots, x_n}$. A **partial solution** is an $i$-tuple $\tup{x_1, \ldots, x_i}$ where $i < n$ and none of the problem constraints are violated (note that this is not necessarily a feasible solution). A partial solution isn't always extendible to a feasible solution - some partial solutions are dead ends, and greedy algorithms can't get an optimal solution here.

A **choice set** for a partial solution $\tup{x_1, \ldots, x_i}$ is the set of all elements we can append to $\tup{x_1, \ldots, x_i}$ to make another, longer partial or feasible solution $\tup{x_1, \ldots, x_i, y}$ - the set of all possible $y$.
