Course Outline
--------------

* Doing Physics - quantities, dimensions, units
* Point kinematics - 1D, 2D, 3D motion
* Point dynamics - force, motion, Newton's laws
* Conservation of energy - work and energy, conservative systems
* Conservation of linear momentum - momentum and systems of particles
* Rotating rigid bodies - kinematics, dynamics, conservation, angular momentum, static equilibrium, torque

Doing Physics
-------------

Problem solving strategy:

1. Read the question and understand what it gives you and what you are being asked to do.
2. Draw a diagram to clarify things if needed (for example, a free-body diagram).
3. Define a coordinate system or reference points.
4. Write out the relevant physical laws that might help with the problem.
5. Figure out a conceptual way to solve the problem.
6. Derive a concrete way to solve the problem using the conceptual way.
7. Solve the problem. (yes, I know)
