<p>Epistemology is the study of knowledge.</p>
<p>Epistemology courses often focus on very abstract, disconnected concepts. This course focuses on the more practical, concrete aspects of modern epistemology - the study of what we know and how we know it, and what we think other people believe or know.</p>
<p>Knowledge tells us how to act, who to trust, which beliefs to form, and how to act virtuously. One good example of the importance of epistemology is in the law - the knowledge and beliefs of the defendant has a significant impact on the proceedings. A defendant that does something unknowingly will be treated differently from one that acts knowingly.</p>
<p>In the law, <strong>ignorance</strong> is not knowing something, and not knowing that one doesn't know. <strong>Willful ignorance</strong> is not knowing something, knowing that one doesn't know, and intentionally avoiding knowing it. Knowledge is awareness and strong belief.</p>

<p>Readings: Quine, Kim</p>
<h2 id="naturalized-and-normalized-epistemology">Naturalized and Normalized Epistemology</h2>
<p>Willard Van Orman Quine proposed <strong>naturalized epistemology</strong>, in opposition to &quot;old philosophy&quot;. In &quot;Epistemology naturalized&quot;, Quine complains about various writings about old epistemology. For example, pragmatically speaking if Descartes doubts the senses then all the sciences are suspect - doubting the senses doesn't leave us with anything practical.</p>
<p>According to Quine, old epistemology views itself as superior to and justifying the existance of science, allowing us to rationally generate discoveries. Additionally, old epistemology cares only about certainty, the things that must be true beyond all doubt (the foundationalist view).</p>
<p>Quine criticizes Descartes' arguments by asking where the guarantee of truth comes from. The commonly accepted answer is that the definition of the words themselves mean that the conclusion follows. Quine then asks where the meanings of words come from, to which it is generally agreed that it is simply convention.</p>
<p>Circular arguments are those that assume what they're trying to prove, and circularity is generally considered a negative feature of science.</p>
<p>In old epistemology, we cannot say we have knowledge until we have certainty. However, certainty is only guaranteed by subjective experiences, valid deductive arguments, and the meaning of words. However, science is based on inductive arguments and observation. Epistemology justifies science, but we actually need to assume things happen in order for science to explain them. Quine criticizes this as being circular - &quot;the world exists because the world exists&quot;.</p>
<p>The inductive arguments that are so essential to science cannot give us certain knowledge. To justify this, David Hume adds the key assumption known as the <strong>Principle of the Uniformity of Nature</strong> - that the future will resemble the past. Hume justifies this inductively, by saying that the future has resembled the past in the past, so the future will resemble the past in the future. However, this is obviously a circular argument. According to Quine, <strong>circularity is unavoidable in epistemology</strong>, and maybe that's just fine.</p>
<p>Quine is essentially criticizing that superiority of old epistemology to science, its reliance on certain knowledge, and its avoidance of circularity. In Quine's naturalized epistemology, science comes first, and <strong>epistemology is a branch of science</strong>, specifically related to cognitive science and psychology. Here, the new goal of epistemology is to understand how science and our practices of science actually work, rather than justifying the existance of science.</p>
<p>Additionally, science is the best way of getting information about the world, so we might as well use science to study science. It is circular to some extent, but this is fine since we no longer care about certainty. It is circular, but not in a way that blocks progress - progress can be made without certainty, through incrementally gaining confidence in our fallible beliefs as we obtain more discoveries and scrutinize our beliefs publicly.</p>
<p>Kim's criticism of Quine's naturalized epistemology starts off by agreeing with Quine's criticism of old epistemology - that naturalized epistemology cannot replace old esptemology. According to naturalized epistemology, individuals accept senses asinput and output beliefs. However, Kim says that there is more to believing and knowing things.</p>
<p>Kim says that the central tenet of epistemology is justification, that epistemologists actually catre about how justified beliefs are formed. In other words, justification is normative, while science is descriptive, so naturalized epistemology cannot answer these normative questions - science cannot tell us how we <strong>should</strong> form beliefs, only <strong>how we do</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, naturalized epistemology cannot tell us what makes evidence good, what beliefs count as being justified, what counts as a fallacy, what is rational to believe, and so on. According to Kim, belief isn't even possible without normative rules - to believe something, one needs a baseline of what counts as believable or not.</p>
<p>If a person believes that it's raining when it's sunny outside, naturalized epistemology would only tell us that the person is wrong, or what caused the wrongness. Epistemology must also be able to tell us what the person should believe instead, any why it is unjustified to think that it is raining.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, there is some egalitarian aspect to this sort of epistemology - beliefs are the same regardless of who thinks them. This is another one of the underlying assumptions in old and naturalized epistemology, though modern epistemology is more likely to take the individual into account.</p>
<p>Knowledge is valuable because it's a foundation to base our science on, according to old epistemology. According to Kim, what counts as justified is normative and cannot be deterined by science.</p>

<p>Readings: Kvanvig, Lackey</p>
<h2 id="assertion">Assertion</h2>
<p>According to Kvanvig, knowledge is not valuable, so we should stop studying it.</p>
<p>Most philosophers agree that knowledge is better than opinion/belief, even if that belief happens to be true. One of these reasons is because the beliefs can be false, while knowledge cannot - <strong>knowledge requires truth</strong>.</p>
<p>Guessing the right answer on a multiple choice test is different from and worse than knowing the right answer. According to Socrates, belief is &quot;untethered&quot;, while knowledge is &quot;tethered&quot; - <strong>knowledge requires justification</strong>.</p>
<p>This leads us to the Justified True Belief (JTB) - a working definition of knowledge as a belief that is both true and justified.</p>
<p>However, this definition is challenged by the <strong>Gettier Problem</strong>, which proposes situations where someone has justified true beliefs, but obviously doesn't have knowledge. These sitations are <strong>Gettier situations</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, you walk past a farm and see things that look exactly like sheep, and believed that there are sheep on the farm. Getting closer, you see that what you saw were actually dogs with long hair. However, there are actually sheep in another part of the farm. Arguably, you did not know that there are sheep on the farm, yet you had a justified true belief.</p>
<p>This implies that there is something more to knowledge - that it requires truth, justification, belief, and even more things. Trying to figure out what these criteria are is an ongoing problem, but Kvanvig says we shouldn't need to care about it.</p>
<p>Kvanvig says that the goal of epistemology is to figure out what the ultimate cognitive state for humans is, and knowledge is not that state. The ultimate state, he says, is that to be able to tell immediately and easily whether any claim that affects one's life is true or false, and that no cognitive mistakes could occur.</p>
<p>Kvanvig argues that it is possible to be in that state without knowing or even understanding what knowledge is. In the example Gettier situation, you had no knowledge that there is a sheep, but ended up correct anyways. Kvanvig says that ideal cognition is possible without knowledge - that you could accidentally get the right answer and it's just as good as knowing the right answer.</p>
<p>However, many object to this by saying that there are certain virtues to knowledge that accidentally true beliefs don't have. Are these virtues important in themselves? Answering a question correctly because of your own knowledge feels better than answering correctly by guessing.</p>
<p>An <strong>assertion</strong> is a claim that something is true. An objection to Kvanvig is that knowledge is needed as a basis for assertion. The <strong>knowledge rule for assertion</strong> says that one should only assert what one knows. Assertion is very practically useful, and if knowledge is the basis of assertion as per the knowledge rule for assertion, then knowledge is not useless, and is worth studying.</p>
<p>The knowledge rule for assertion is suppoorted by real-world usage of assertions. Intuitively, what we want to assert as true are things that are true - when we ask someone what the current time is, we want the right answer. We might also want to ask them how they came up with that answer - how did they get the current time? We can challenge assertions by presenting evidence that the assertion was false, or saying that there is no evidence that what they asserted is actually true. In other words, assertions are proper not when we are wrong, but when we don't have knowledge of what we assert.</p>
<p>Lackey presents <strong>selfless assertion</strong> - when someone makes an assertion without having any knowledge about it, but the assertion is still proper. In the case of askin someone what the current time is, Lackey says that the mind of the person being asked doesn't matter.</p>
<p>For example, a pediatrician who, in grief of his daughter being diagnosed with autism, starts believe that vaccines cause autism, even though he also respects the teachings of science. To his patients, he says that this is not the case, because he thinks that this is most likely to be true, and this is what is in the best interests of the patients. The argument is that the pediatrician does not believe something, and therefore did not have knowledge of something, but his assertion is still proper, even if the patients know that he doesn't have knowledge of what he is asserting. Basically, he believes one thing, but asserts another in the best interests of his patients.</p>
<p>In other words, selfless assertion challenges either the knowledge rule, or the idea that knowledge requires belief (this is supported by the pediatrician thinking that there being no connection is most likely to be true). Perhaps the pediatrician believes both (even though they are conflicting), or the &quot;best interests&quot; qualifier has some significance.</p>
<p>;wip: potentially a good topic for the paper is whether a better rule for assertion is whether what is asserted is in the best interests of people being asserted to</p>
<p>Another example is a Catholic teacher who believes in creationism, but still teaches students the evidence presented by science. Although the teacher's faith has her believe one thing, she asserts another, without having knowledge, and this seems to be a proper assertion. However, the examples provided so far have been quite complex, and it is important to consider other factors in play that could influence how we view the assertions or knowledge.</p>
<h1 id="section-3">23/9/15</h1>
<p>Readings: Turri</p>
<p>;wip: do critical response 1 and submit via learn</p>
<p>There are different types of speech acts, and each one have their own norms and rules. For example, guessing has different norms from speculating, conjecturing, asserting, promising, or guaranteeing. The norms and rules are what we are trying to define for each relevant speech act.</p>
<p>There are different types of normativity. <strong>Constitutive normalivity</strong> are the internal rules that consitute a practice - the rules that basically define the practice. <strong>Moral normativity</strong> are rules that say when a practice is morally permissible - the rules than define when we should do the practice. <strong>Prudential normativity</strong> are rules that say when a practice is prudent/wise - when it would be a good idea to do a practice.</p>
<p>For example, the rules of chess is contitutive normativity, while going easy on new chess players is moral normativity. If you have a bet that you will lose a chess game, it would be prudent to lose it in order to win the bet, and this is prudential normativity.</p>
<p>What is the constitutive norm of assertion? In other words, what is the fundamental rule of assertion? Do assertions need to be factive (requires truth)?</p>
<p>One factive account of assertion is the <strong>truth rule</strong> - one should assert something only if it's true, and knowledge/justification/belief is not necessary.</p>
<p>Another factive account is the <strong>knowledge rule</strong>, which we looked at earlier - one should assert something only if you know it, so that needs truth, belief, and evidence.</p>
<p>A non-fictive account is the <strong>belief rule</strong> - one should assert something only if one believes it, so it's still fine even if the assertion is totally false.</p>
<p>Another non-fictive account is the <strong>justification rule</strong> - one should assert something only one can justify it, so that needs belief and justification.</p>
<p>Lackey's account is non-factive, and modern literature tends to favor non-factive accounts. It feels like when people make well-justified assertions that turn out to be false, they didn't do anything wrong and are not to blame. In other words, there are <strong>reasonable false assertions</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, if we have 99.9% certainty that something would happen, it seems proper to assert it as true, even though we could turn out to be wrong - we should not be to blame for making such an assertion.</p>
<p>Turri's account is a factive one, and he argues for the knowledge rule. According to Turri, if assertion is rule governed, then we should look at how people are actually acting out these rules in real life, particularly people who are competent at using the language - we should obtain empirical evidence for rules governing assertion.</p>
<p>Turri conducted social psychology experiments, testing how people reacted to assertions in a game for whether people approve or disapprove of well justified false assertions, both when it turns out true, and when it turns out false.</p>
<p>As it turns out, people think false but justified assertions should not be made, even when that justification is very good. However, various objections to these results were raised, such as the experiment also measuring prudential/moral normativity rather than just constitutive normativity. Also, there was a sliding scale from &quot;very wrong&quot; to &quot;very right&quot;, to eliminate the possibility of a false dichotomy.</p>
<p>In response, Turri conducted further experiments with different situations in order to eliminate variables. The reasoning was <strong>excuse validation</strong> - the maker of the false assertion has a reasonable excuse for being wrong. Turri concludes that factive accounts of assertion better explain people's reactions to assertions.</p>
<p>Interestingly, blame depends on character judgements of the person - when people perceived as good broke a rule, they were blamed less or not considered to have broken rules more often than people perceived as bad. In other words, people will simply say someone did not break the rule if they are not to blame, because blame is associated with punishment, and a blameless person doesn't deserve punishment.</p>
