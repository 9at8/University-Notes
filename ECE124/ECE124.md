Boolean Algebra
---------------

See the CS245 notes for description of Boolean algebra.

Binary functions are defined using a truth table, or a Boolean logic formula. An example of a binary function is $f = f(x, y)$. Problem with truth tables is that they're big, and hard to manipulate.

Boolean AND is represented with $x \cdot y$, $xy$, or $x \wedge y$. The schematic symbol for this operation is a rectangle with one side completely rounded into a semicircle with the output wire, and the other flat and with input wires.

Boolean OR is represented with $x + y$. The schematic symbol for this operation is a rectangle with one side completely rounded into a semicircle with the output wire, with the other side curved inward and has input wires leading into it.

Boolean NOT is represented with $\overline x$, $!x$, $x'$, or $\neg x$. The schematic symbol for this operation is a triangle with a circle on the pointed end, which has the output wire, and the input wire is on the other end.

There is also an order of operations for these operations. From highest precedence to lowest, the operators are NOT, AND, and OR.

Minterms/Maxterms
-----------------

A **minterm** is a particular Boolean expression for a particular input to an $n$-input function. The minterm is special because it is easy to construct algorithmically from a truth table.

The minterm of a truth table row is the an OR expression with an operand for each function input where each operand is $x_i$ if $x_i = 1$ for that row and $\neg x_i$ if $x_i = 0$.

Given a truth table, we can construct an expression that is equivalent to the function it represents as follows:

1. Create an empty expression $m$.
2. For each row $x_0, \ldots, x_n, f$ in the truth table:
  1. Create an empty expression $m_i$.
  2. For all $1 \le i \le n$:
    1. If $x_i = 0$, let $m_i$ become $m_i \cdot \neg x_i$.
    2. If $x_i = 1$, let $m_i$ become $m_i \cdot x_i$.
  3. If and only if $f = 1$, let $m$ become $m \vee m_i$. Note that $m_i$ is true if and only if the inputs match those in the current row of the truth table.
3. Note that $m$ is true if and only if $f = 1$, since there is an $m_i$ term for all the rows in the truth table that are true, and none of them match any rows in the truth table that are not true.

Here, each $m_i$ is a minterm. $m$ is the sum of minterms/canonical sum of products, defined below.

The **canonical sum of products/sum of minterms** is when we OR all the minterms ($m_i$) that have $f = 1$ for their corresponding truth table rows, in order.

The **maxterms** of a function are the duals of the minterms - similar to the minterms, but with AND instead of OR, and $\neg x$ and $x$ where we used to have $x$ and $\neg x$.

The maxterm of a truth table row is the an OR expression with an operand for each function input where each operand is $x_i$ if $x_i = 1$ for that row and $\neg x_i$ if $x_i = 0$.

The maxterm is true if and only if the inputs _do not match the inputs in the corresponding row in the truth table_. This is the opposite of a minterm being true if and only if the inputs do match the inputs.

The **canonical product of sums/product of maxterms** is when we AND all the maxterms that have $f = 0$ for their corresponding truth table rows, in order. In other words, it is an expression that ensures that the inputs do not match the first row resulting in 0, and do not match the second row resulting in 0, and so on.

The sum of minterms and product of maxterms are special because it is exactly equivalent to the original function. The term **canonical** means that they are unique - there is only one way to write it correctly.

Minterms determine when we need to turn the function on. Maxterms determine when we need to turn the function off.

A $n$-level expression is an expression that has a tree depth of $n$. $xy + z$ is a 2-level expression, and when we draw the circuit, it has 2 levels of gates - the depth of the circuit tree.

For example, if a 2-input function has the following truth table:

| x | y | f |
|:--|:--|:--|
| 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |

The minterms are $\neg x \neg y$ and $x y$, and the maxterms are $x \neg y$ and $\neg x y$. As a result, we can write $f$ as $\neg x \neg y + x y$ (sum of minterms) or $(x + \neg y)(\neg x + y)$ (product of maxterms).

Our goal is to use the simplest possible circuits. We can choose whether to use the sum of minterms or product of maxterms, but we can also use Boolean algebra to further simplify any expression.

Boolean Algebra
---------------

Axioms of Boolean algebra:

1. Closure over operations: given $x, y \in \set{0, 1}$, $x \cdot y, x + y, \neg x \in \set{0, 1}$.
2. Operation identities: given $x \in \set{0, 1}$, $x + 0 = x$ and $x \cdot 1 = x$. $0$ is the OR identity and $1$ is the AND identity.
3. Commutativity: given $x, y \in \set{0, 1}$, $x + y = y + x$ and $x \cdot y = y \cdot x$.
4. Distributivity: $x + y \cdot z = (x + y) \cdot (x + z)$ (distributivity over OR) and $x \cdot (y + z) = x \cdot y + x \cdot z$.
5. Negation existance: given $x \in \set{0, 1}$, there must exist an element $\neg x$ such that $x + \neg x = 1$ and $x \cdot \neg x = 0$.
6. Unique elements: there must exist $x, y \in \set{0, 1}$ such that $x \ne y$.

We can now prove theorems using truth tables, or using axioms:

Additional theorems:

1. $x + x = x$ and $x \cdot x = x$
2. $x + 1 = 1$ and $x \cdot 0 = 0$
3. $\neg \neg x = x$ (double negation)
4. $x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z$ and $x \cdot (y \cdot z) = (x \cdot y) \cdot z$ (associativity)
5. $\neg (x + y) = \neg x \cdot \neg y$ and $\neg (x \cdot y) = \neg x + \neg y$ (De Morgan's Law)
6. $x + x \cdot y = x$ and $x \cdot (x + y) = x$ (adsorption)
