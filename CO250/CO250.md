In this course, we will be studying linear programming, integer programming, the Simplex algorithm, and the concept of duality, as well as various ways to efficiently approximate answers to these sorts of problems.

An **abstract optimization problem** (also known as a "P") is a problem in which we are trying to maximize or minimize a certain objective function - finding the inputs to the function, subject to certain constraints, such that the value of the function is maximised. In other words, given $A \subseteq \mb{R}^n$ (the set of all **feasible inputs**) and a function $f: A \to \mb{R}$ (the **objective function**), find $x \in A$ such that $f(x)$ is the global maximum/minimum.

Optimization problems show up in almost every industry - hardware companies might want to simplify their circuit layouts, hotels might want to fill the most rooms possible at the highest price, and a factory might want to generate the most profit given constraints on materials and labour. Also, you can use it to play Pandemic optimally.

There are three types of abstract optimization problems:

* Linear programming problems (also known as LPs) are abstract optimization problems where $A$ is representable as a set of linear equations/inequalities, and $f$ is a linear function.
* Integer programming problems (also known as IPs) are linear programming problems where $A \subseteq \mb{Z}^n$.
* Non-linear programming problems (also known as NLPs) are abstract optimization problems where $A$ cannot be represented as a set of linear equations/inequalities, or $f$ is non-linear.

Abstract optimization problems are usually given as prose descriptions of the problems, which we then turn into abstract mathematical models/programs/problems. Then, we can take advantage of the many powerful computer solvers available today to automatically find optimal solutions.

Suppose a company produces either plastic carrots (which sell for $5 each and take 4 minutes to make) or rubber potatoes (which sell for $8 each and take 8 minutes to make). The company has 500 minutes available in the rest of the day, and the machine that makes either of these products can only be used up to 100 times - how many of each product should be made to maximize profit?

> First, we define our decision variables - the actual values we are trying to find. Let $c$ be the number of carrots, and $p$ be the number of potatoes.  
> Profit can now be defined as a function of those decision variables: $f(c, p) = 5c + 8p$.  
> Next, we can define constraints to specify $A$. There are only 500 minutes left, and the time spent depends on the number of each product made, so $4c + 8p \le 500$. There are only 100 products left that we can make, and this is simply the number of carrots and potatoes, so $c + p \le 100$. Additionally, $c$ and $p$ must be non-negative, since they represent the number of each product.  
> We now have a mathematical model of the problem: "maximize $5c + 3p$ subject to $4c + 3p \le 500$ and $c + p \le 100$".  

A **feasible solution** to an abstract optimization problem is any $x \in A$ - any variable assignment such that the constraints of the problem are satisfied, like $c = 50, p = 10$. An **optimal** solution is one that actually solves the problem - a feasible solution that results in the global maximum/minimum of the objective function. Likewise, feasible solutions to prose descriptions of the problem are assignments to the unknowns, like "make 50 carrots and 10 potatoes".

To show that a mathematical model of a problem is correct (properly represents the prose description of the problem), we usually define a bijection between feasible solutions for the mathematical model and feasible solutions for the prose description of the problem, such that the bijection **preserves cost** - each $x \in A$ for the mathematical model must have $f(x)$ equal to the the profit in the prose description for its corresponding feasible solution.

For example, show that the model from the above example is correct:

> $4c + 3p \le 500 \land c + p \le 100$ can be trivially bijected to "carrots take 4 minutes to make and potatoes take 8 minutes, and the machine can only be used to make 100 products".  
> Clearly, $f(c, p) = 5c + 8p$ has the same value as the profit since "carrots sell for $5 each and potatoes sell for $8 each".

In this course we will mostly focus on affine optimization problems, since solving general optimization problems is much harder.

An **affine function** is one that can be written as $f(\vec{x}) = \vec{a} \cdot \vec{x} + \beta$ where $\vec{a} \in \mb{R}^n$ and $\beta \in \mb{R}$. If $\beta = 0$, the function is also **linear**.

A **linear program** is an abstract optimization problem of the form $\min \set{f(x) : x \in \mb{R}^n \wedge \left(\forall 1 \le i \le m, g_i(x) \le b_i\right)}$ where $f$ is affine, $g_1, \ldots, g_m$ are all linear, and $m$ is finite. We might also replace $\min$ with $\max$ depending on the problem. 

Usually we write this as: "minimize $f(x)$ subject to $g_1 \le b_1, \ldots, g_m \le b_m$", or "maximize $f(x)$ s.t. $g_1 \le b_1, \ldots, g_m \le b_m$". It's also common to use $\vec{x} \le \mb{0}$ as shorthand for $x_1 \ge 0, \ldots, x_n \ge 0$.

Suppose an oil company in the next 4 months needs to supply 5000L, 8000L, 9000L, and 6000L, respectively, and oil costs them 0.75/L, 0.72/L, 0.92/L, and 0.90/L, respectively. The company has an oil tank that can store up to 4000L, and starts off with 2000L. Oil is bought at the beginning of the month, is used throughout the month, and is all dumped into the tank at the end of the month. What quantity of oil should be bought in each month to minimize cost?

> Clearly, the inputs are the quantity of oil bought in each month, $b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4$. For convenience, we will also define the tank value at the beginning of each month, $t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4$. Clearly, $0 \le t_1 \le 4000, 0 \le t_2 \le 4000, 0 \le t_3 \le 4000, 0 \le t_4 \le 4000$, since the capacity of the tank is 4000L.  
> The objective function we are minimizing is $f(b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4) = 0.75b_1 + 0.72b_2 + 0.92b_3 + 0.90b_4$.  
> Clearly, the tank level in month $i$ is $t_1 = 2000, t_2 = t_1 + b_1 - 5000, t_3 = t_2 + b_2 - 8000, t_4 = t_3 + b_3 - 9000$, since the tank level is just the leftover oil after supplying the last month's oil.  
> Clearly, in order to supply enough oil, we must have $t_1 + b_1 \ge 5000, t_2 + b_2 \ge 8000, t_3 + b_3 \ge 9000, t_4 + b_4 \ge 6000$. However, the first three constraints are redundant with the previously defined constraints $t_2 = t_1 + b_1 - 5000, t_3 = t_2 + b_2 - 8000, t_4 = t_3 + b_3 - 9000$ and $0 \le t_1, 0 \le t_2, 0 \le t_3, 0 \le t_4$, so we only need the $t_4 + b_4 \ge 6000$ constraint.  
> These encode all of the problem constraints, so we have "minimize $0.75b_1 + 0.72b_2 + 0.92b_3 + 0.90b_4$ subject to $0 \le t_1 \le 4000, 0 \le t_2 \le 4000, 0 \le t_3 \le 4000, 0 \le t_4 \le 4000$ and $t_1 = 2000, t_2 = t_1 + b_1 - 5000, t_3 = t_2 + b_2 - 8000, t_4 = t_3 + b_3 - 9000$ and $t_4 \ge 6000$".  
> If we use a linear programming solver, we get $b_1 = 3000, b_2 = 12000, b_3 = 5000, b_4 = 6000$, which gives us the minimum cost 20890.  

Same thing, but minimise the maximum amount of oil purchased in any single month, and then show that the model is correct assuming that the above example's model was correct:

> From the previous example, we have the same constraints $0 \le t_1 \le 4000, 0 \le t_2 \le 4000, 0 \le t_3 \le 4000, 0 \le t_4 \le 4000$ and $t_1 = 2000, t_2 = t_1 + b_1 - 5000, t_3 = t_2 + b_2 - 8000, t_4 = t_3 + b_3 - 9000$ and $t_4 \ge 6000$.  
> However, the objective function is different - let $M$ be the maximum amount of oil bought in a single month, and we can minimize this value. We can define $M$ to be the maximum amount of oil bought in a single month by adding the constraints $b_1 \le M, b_2 \le M, b_3 \le M, b_4 \le M$.  
> These encode all of the problem constraints, so we have "minimize $M$ subject to $0 \le t_1 \le 4000, 0 \le t_2 \le 4000, 0 \le t_3 \le 4000, 0 \le t_4 \le 4000$ and $t_1 = 2000, t_2 = t_1 + b_1 - 5000, t_3 = t_2 + b_2 - 8000, t_4 = t_3 + b_3 - 9000$ and $t_4 \ge 6000$ and $b_1 \le M, b_2 \le M, b_3 \le M, b_4 \le M$".  
> Now to show correctness. Suppose that $M$ is an optimal solution that has values $b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4$. Since $M$ is a feasible solution, $M \ge \max\set{b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4}$, and since $M$ is an optimal solution, it is the lowest such value that satisfies that, so $M = \max\set{b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4}$. Therefore, $M$ is also the minimum maximum amount of oil purchased in any single month.
