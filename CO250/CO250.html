<p>Introduction to optimization.</p>
<pre><code>Levent Tunçel
Section 081 (online)
Email: ltuncel@uwaterloo.ca</code></pre>
<h1 id="section">3/1/17</h1>
<p>In this course, we will be studying linear programming, integer programming, the Simplex algorithm, and the concept of duality, as well as various ways to efficiently approximate answers to these sorts of problems.</p>
<p>An <strong>abstract optimization problem</strong> (also known as a &quot;P&quot;) is a problem in which we are trying to maximize or minimize a certain objective function - finding the inputs to the function, subject to certain constraints, such that the value of the function is maximised. In other words, given <span class="math inline">\(A \subseteq \mb{R}^n\)</span> (the set of all <strong>feasible inputs</strong>) and a function <span class="math inline">\(f: A \to \mb{R}\)</span> (the <strong>objective function</strong>), find <span class="math inline">\(x \in A\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> is the global maximum/minimum.</p>
<p>Optimization problems show up in almost every industry - hardware companies might want to simplify their circuit layouts, hotels might want to fill the most rooms possible at the highest price, and a factory might want to generate the most profit given constraints on materials and labour. Also, you can use it to play Pandemic optimally.</p>
<p>There are three types of abstract optimization problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linear programming problems (also known as LPs) are abstract optimization problems where <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is representable as a set of linear equations/inequalities, and <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a linear function.</li>
<li>Integer programming problems (also known as IPs) are linear programming problems where <span class="math inline">\(A \subseteq \mb{Z}^n\)</span>.</li>
<li>Non-linear programming problems (also known as NLPs) are abstract optimization problems where <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> cannot be represented as a set of linear equations/inequalities, or <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is non-linear.</li>
</ul>
<p>Abstract optimization problems are usually given as prose descriptions of the problems, which we then turn into abstract mathematical models/programs/problems. Then, we can take advantage of the many powerful computer solvers available today to automatically find optimal solutions.</p>
<p>Suppose a company produces either plastic carrots (which sell for $5 each and take 4 minutes to make) or rubber potatoes (which sell for $8 each and take 8 minutes to make). The company has 500 minutes available in the rest of the day, and the machine that makes either of these products can only be used up to 100 times - how many of each product should be made to maximize profit?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, we define our decision variables - the actual values we are trying to find. Let <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> be the number of carrots, and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> be the number of potatoes.<br />
Profit can now be defined as a function of those decision variables: <span class="math inline">\(f(c, p) = 5c + 8p\)</span>.<br />
Next, we can define constraints to specify <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. There are only 500 minutes left, and the time spent depends on the number of each product made, so <span class="math inline">\(4c + 8p \le 500\)</span>. There are only 100 products left that we can make, and this is simply the number of carrots and potatoes, so <span class="math inline">\(c + p \le 100\)</span>. Additionally, <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> must be non-negative, since they represent the number of each product.<br />
We now have a mathematical model of the problem: &quot;maximize <span class="math inline">\(5c + 3p\)</span> subject to <span class="math inline">\(4c + 3p \le 500\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c + p \le 100\)</span>&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <strong>feasible solution</strong> to an abstract optimization problem is any <span class="math inline">\(x \in A\)</span> - any variable assignment such that the constraints of the problem are satisfied, like <span class="math inline">\(c = 50, p = 10\)</span>. An <strong>optimal</strong> solution is one that actually solves the problem - a feasible solution that results in the global maximum/minimum of the objective function. Likewise, feasible solutions to prose descriptions of the problem are assignments to the unknowns, like &quot;make 50 carrots and 10 potatoes&quot;.</p>
<p>To show that a mathematical model of a problem is correct (properly represents the prose description of the problem), we usually define a bijection between feasible solutions for the mathematical model and feasible solutions for the prose description of the problem, such that the bijection <strong>preserves cost</strong> - each <span class="math inline">\(x \in A\)</span> for the mathematical model must have <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> equal to the the profit in the prose description for its corresponding feasible solution.</p>
<p>For example, show that the model from the above example is correct:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="math inline">\(4c + 3p \le 500 \land c + p \le 100\)</span> can be trivially bijected to &quot;carrots take 4 minutes to make and potatoes take 8 minutes, and the machine can only be used to make 100 products&quot;.<br />
Clearly, <span class="math inline">\(f(c, p) = 5c + 8p\)</span> has the same value as the profit since &quot;carrots sell for $5 each and potatoes sell for $8 each&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="section-1">5/1/17</h1>
<p>In this course we will mostly focus on affine optimization problems, since solving general optimization problems is much harder.</p>
<p>An <strong>affine function</strong> is one that can be written as <span class="math inline">\(f(\vec{x}) = \vec{a} \cdot \vec{x} + \beta\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\vec{a} \in \mb{R}^n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta \in \mb{R}\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(\beta = 0\)</span>, the function is also <strong>linear</strong>.</p>
<p>A <strong>linear program</strong> is an abstract optimization problem of the form <span class="math inline">\(\min \set{f(x) : x \in \mb{R}^n \wedge \left(\forall 1 \le i \le m, g_i(x) \le b_i\right)}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is affine, <span class="math inline">\(g_1, \ldots, g_m\)</span> are all linear, and <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is finite. We might also replace <span class="math inline">\(\min\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\max\)</span> depending on the problem.</p>
<p>Usually we write this as: &quot;minimize <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> subject to <span class="math inline">\(g_1 \le b_1, \ldots, g_m \le b_m\)</span>&quot;, or &quot;maximize <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> s.t. <span class="math inline">\(g_1 \le b_1, \ldots, g_m \le b_m\)</span>&quot;. It's also common to use <span class="math inline">\(\vec{x} \le \mb{0}\)</span> as shorthand for <span class="math inline">\(x_1 \ge 0, \ldots, x_n \ge 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Suppose an oil company in the next 4 months needs to supply 5000L, 8000L, 9000L, and 6000L, respectively, and oil costs them 0.75/L, 0.72/L, 0.92/L, and 0.90/L, respectively. The company has an oil tank that can store up to 4000L, and starts off with 2000L. Oil is bought at the beginning of the month, is used throughout the month, and is all dumped into the tank at the end of the month. What quantity of oil should be bought in each month to minimize cost?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clearly, the inputs are the quantity of oil bought in each month, <span class="math inline">\(b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4\)</span>. For convenience, we will also define the tank value at the beginning of each month, <span class="math inline">\(t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4\)</span>. Clearly, <span class="math inline">\(0 \le t_1 \le 4000, 0 \le t_2 \le 4000, 0 \le t_3 \le 4000, 0 \le t_4 \le 4000\)</span>, since the capacity of the tank is 4000L.<br />
The objective function we are minimizing is <span class="math inline">\(f(b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4) = 0.75b_1 + 0.72b_2 + 0.92b_3 + 0.90b_4\)</span>.<br />
Clearly, the tank level in month <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(t_1 = 2000, t_2 = t_1 + b_1 - 5000, t_3 = t_2 + b_2 - 8000, t_4 = t_3 + b_3 - 9000\)</span>, since the tank level is just the leftover oil after supplying the last month's oil.<br />
Clearly, in order to supply enough oil, we must have <span class="math inline">\(t_1 + b_1 \ge 5000, t_2 + b_2 \ge 8000, t_3 + b_3 \ge 9000, t_4 + b_4 \ge 6000\)</span>. However, the first three constraints are redundant with the previously defined constraints <span class="math inline">\(t_2 = t_1 + b_1 - 5000, t_3 = t_2 + b_2 - 8000, t_4 = t_3 + b_3 - 9000\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(0 \le t_1, 0 \le t_2, 0 \le t_3, 0 \le t_4\)</span>, so we only need the <span class="math inline">\(t_4 + b_4 \ge 6000\)</span> constraint.<br />
These encode all of the problem constraints, so we have &quot;minimize <span class="math inline">\(0.75b_1 + 0.72b_2 + 0.92b_3 + 0.90b_4\)</span> subject to <span class="math inline">\(0 \le t_1 \le 4000, 0 \le t_2 \le 4000, 0 \le t_3 \le 4000, 0 \le t_4 \le 4000\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t_1 = 2000, t_2 = t_1 + b_1 - 5000, t_3 = t_2 + b_2 - 8000, t_4 = t_3 + b_3 - 9000\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t_4 \ge 6000\)</span>&quot;.<br />
If we use a linear programming solver, we get <span class="math inline">\(b_1 = 3000, b_2 = 12000, b_3 = 5000, b_4 = 6000\)</span>, which gives us the minimum cost 20890.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Same thing, but minimise the maximum amount of oil purchased in any single month, and then show that the model is correct assuming that the above example's model was correct:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the previous example, we have the same constraints <span class="math inline">\(0 \le t_1 \le 4000, 0 \le t_2 \le 4000, 0 \le t_3 \le 4000, 0 \le t_4 \le 4000\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t_1 = 2000, t_2 = t_1 + b_1 - 5000, t_3 = t_2 + b_2 - 8000, t_4 = t_3 + b_3 - 9000\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t_4 \ge 6000\)</span>.<br />
However, the objective function is different - let <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> be the maximum amount of oil bought in a single month, and we can minimize this value. We can define <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> to be the maximum amount of oil bought in a single month by adding the constraints <span class="math inline">\(b_1 \le M, b_2 \le M, b_3 \le M, b_4 \le M\)</span>.<br />
These encode all of the problem constraints, so we have &quot;minimize <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> subject to <span class="math inline">\(0 \le t_1 \le 4000, 0 \le t_2 \le 4000, 0 \le t_3 \le 4000, 0 \le t_4 \le 4000\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t_1 = 2000, t_2 = t_1 + b_1 - 5000, t_3 = t_2 + b_2 - 8000, t_4 = t_3 + b_3 - 9000\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t_4 \ge 6000\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_1 \le M, b_2 \le M, b_3 \le M, b_4 \le M\)</span>&quot;.<br />
Now to show correctness. Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is an optimal solution that has values <span class="math inline">\(b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is a feasible solution, <span class="math inline">\(M \ge \max\set{b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4}\)</span>, and since <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is an optimal solution, it is the lowest such value that satisfies that, so <span class="math inline">\(M = \max\set{b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4}\)</span>. Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is also the minimum maximum amount of oil purchased in any single month.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="section-2">10/1/17</h1>
<p>Integer programs are just linear programs plus a integrality constraint - a constraint that all of the variables must be integers. When we formulate integer programs, we just add the constraint <span class="math inline">\(x_1, \ldots, x_n \text{ are integral}\)</span>.</p>
<p>An integer program is <strong>mixed</strong> if there are still non-integral variables, and <strong>pure</strong> if it only has integral variables. Integer programs are harder to solve than LPs.</p>
<p>The size of a linear/integer program generally refers to either the number of variables, of the number of constraints. The running time of an IP/LP solver algorithm is the number of steps it takes, as a function of the size of the IP/LP.</p>
<p>Efficient algorithms are polynomially. All LPs can be solved in polynomial time, though with a high exponent. Solving integer programs, however, are in NP, and so are highly unlikely to be solvable in polynomial time.</p>
<p>The knapsack problem is a special case of integer programs. Given a set of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> items, with values <span class="math inline">\(v_1, \ldots, v_n\)</span> and weights <span class="math inline">\(w_1, \ldots, w_n\)</span>, how do we maximize the total value of the items we can carry in a knapsack given that the total weight cannot exceed <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>? From CS341, we know that if the number of items can be fractional, we can just use a greedy algorithm.</p>
<p>As an integer program, we have: maximize <span class="math inline">\(v_1 x_1 + \ldots = v_n x_n\)</span> subject to <span class="math inline">\(w_1 x_1 + \ldots + w_n x_n \le m\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x_1, \ldots, x_n \text{ are integral}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Write the IP for a knapsack problem where we have <span class="math inline">\(n = 4\)</span> and either <span class="math inline">\(x_1 + x_2\)</span> is at least 4, or <span class="math inline">\(x_3 + x_4\)</span> is at least 4, and we can only send <span class="math inline">\(x_3\)</span> if we send at least one <span class="math inline">\(x_4\)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're trying to maximize <span class="math inline">\(v_1 x_1 + v_2 x_2 + v_3 x_3 + v_4 x_4\)</span>.<br />
Clearly, we can express <span class="math inline">\(x_1 + x_2 \ge 4\)</span> AND <span class="math inline">\(x_3 = x_4 \ge 4\)</span>, but how do we express <span class="math inline">\(x_1 + x_2 \ge 4\)</span> OR <span class="math inline">\(x_3 + x_4 \ge 4\)</span>?<br />
One way to do this is by adding a binary variable <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> to our IP, constrained such that <span class="math inline">\(0 \le y \le 1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y \text{ is integral}\)</span>.<br />
We can now express <span class="math inline">\(x_1 + x_2 \ge 4 \lor x_3 + x_4 \ge 4\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(x_1 + x_2 \ge 4y, x_3 + x_4 \ge 4(1 - y)\)</span>. Whenever <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is 0, <span class="math inline">\(4y\)</span> is 0, so <span class="math inline">\(x_1 + x_2\)</span> will always be true (since <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span> are non-negative), while <span class="math inline">\(4(1 - y)\)</span> is 4, so the second constraint becomes <span class="math inline">\(x_3 + x_4 \ge 4\)</span>. Whenever <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is 1, <span class="math inline">\(4y\)</span> is 4, so the first constraint becomes <span class="math inline">\(x_1 + x_2 \ge 4\)</span>, while the second constraint is always true (since <span class="math inline">\(x_3\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_4\)</span> are non-negative).<br />
Now, how do we express sending <span class="math inline">\(x_3\)</span> only if we send at least one <span class="math inline">\(x_4\)</span>? We want to express that <span class="math inline">\(x_4 = 0 \implies x_3 = 0\)</span>.<br />
One way to do this is to multiply <span class="math inline">\(x_4\)</span> by a large enough value so that if it's 1 or more, the resulting value will definitely be greater than <span class="math inline">\(x_3\)</span>. For example, <span class="math inline">\(x_3\)</span> must be no greater than <span class="math inline">\(\floor{\frac m {w_3}}\)</span>, so we can add the constraint <span class="math inline">\(x_3 \le \floor{\frac m {w_3}} x_4\)</span> to do this. When <span class="math inline">\(x_4 = 0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\floor{\frac m {w_3}} x_4\)</span> is also 0, so <span class="math inline">\(x_3\)</span> must be 0 as well. When <span class="math inline">\(x_4 \ge 1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\floor{\frac m {w_3}} x_4 \ge \floor{\frac m {w_3}}\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(x_3 \le \floor{\frac m {w_3}} x_4\)</span> is always true.<br />
Therefore, we can write this as &quot;maximize <span class="math inline">\(v_1 x_1 + v_2 x_2 + v_3 x_3 + v_4 x_4\)</span> subject to <span class="math inline">\(w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + w_3 x_3 + w_4 x_4 \le m\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x_1 + x_2 \ge 4y\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x_3 + x_4 \ge 4(1 - y)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0 \le y \le 1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y \text{ is integral}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x_3 \le \floor{\frac m {w_3}} x_4\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 \ge 0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 \text{ is integral}\)</span>&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above example demonstrates a common trick of using a <strong>binary variable</strong> to express logical constraints involving disjunction. The binary variable lets us make constraints that apply when it has one value, and always be true for other values.</p>
<p>Scheduling is one of the most common optimization problems in industry. Suppose we have the coffee shop that is open on weekdays, hires workers that work for 4 consecutive weekdays per week (can wrap around weeks, and ignoring weekends), and requires 3, 5, 9, 2, and 7 workers to meet demand on Monday through Friday, respectively. How do we hire the smallest number of workers that meets this demand, and how do we schedule them to meet this demand?</p>
<p>First, we could define 5 variables, <span class="math inline">\(x_1, \ldots, x_5\)</span>, for the number of workers who should start working on each weekday. Then, the objective becomes to minimize <span class="math inline">\(x_1 + \ldots + x_5\)</span>.</p>
<p>What are the feasible solutions? Well, the constraints are that the number of workers starting on each day must be non-negative, and that the demand is met each day. To ensure we have enough demand for each day, we can define five constraints for each weekday. For example, for Monday demand to be met, we need the number of workers who start on Monday, Friday, Thursday, or Wednesday to be at least 3, since Monday demand is 3 and on Monday, we have workers from up to 4 days ago: <span class="math inline">\(x_1 + x_5 + x_4 + x_3 \ge 3\)</span>.</p>
<p>So, the problem becomes: &quot;minimize <span class="math inline">\(x_1 + \ldots + x_5\)</span> subject to <span class="math inline">\(x_1 + x_5 + x_4 + x_3 \ge 3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x_2 + x_1 + x_5 + x_4 \ge 5\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x_3 + x_2 + x_1 + x_5 \ge 9\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x_4 + x_3 + x_2 + x_1 \ge 2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x_5 + x_4 + x_3 + x_2 \ge 7\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(x_1, \ldots, x_5 \ge 0\)</span>&quot;.</p>
<p>Suppose we wanted to constrain a variable <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to be one of <span class="math inline">\(k_1, \ldots, k_n\)</span>. One way we could do this is to have binary variables <span class="math inline">\(y_1, \ldots, y_n\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span> represents <span class="math inline">\(x = k_i\)</span> - adding a constraint of the form <span class="math inline">\(x = k_1 y_1 + \ldots + k_n y_n\)</span>. Then, we can ensure that exactly one of them is true by adding the constraint <span class="math inline">\(y_1 + \ldots y_n = 1\)</span>.</p>

<p>Another common type of linear programming problem in the real world is graph optimization. For example, how do we find the shortest path on a map? How do we optimize a microchip layout?</p>
<p>For the shortest path on a map example, we can associate street intersections with vertices, and streets with edges, weighted by the distance (a non-negative real number) along its length between intersections.</p>
<p>An <span class="math inline">\(s, t\)</span>-walk in a graph is a sequence of edges <span class="math inline">\(s v_1, v_1 v_2, \ldots, v_k t\)</span>. An <span class="math inline">\(s, t\)</span>-path is an <span class="math inline">\(s, t\)</span>-walk such that non-consecutive edges in the sequence don't share any vertices (we never revisit the same vertex twice).</p>
<p>The length of an <span class="math inline">\(s, t\)</span>-path is the sum of the weights of the edges in the path. So, given a graph <span class="math inline">\(G = \tup{V, E}\)</span>, a weight function <span class="math inline">\(w: E \to \mb{R}\)</span>, and two vertices <span class="math inline">\(s, t\)</span>, we want to find the minimum length <span class="math inline">\(s, t\)</span>-path. How do we write this as an IP?</p>
<p>Suppose we have tasks <span class="math inline">\(t = t_1, \ldots, t_n\)</span> and machines <span class="math inline">\(m = m_1, \ldots, m_n\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(c_{m_i, t_j}\)</span> represents the cost of having machine <span class="math inline">\(m_i\)</span> perform task <span class="math inline">\(t_j\)</span>. How do we match machines to tasks to minimize total cost?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create a graph with one vertex for each job and edges between them weighted by the corresponding cost.<br />
We want to find the perfect (every vertex in the graph is incident to an edge in the matching) matching (subset of edges such that none share vertices) in the bipartite graph with the minimum total weight.<br />
Let <span class="math inline">\(\delta(v)\)</span> be a function that returns the set of all edges incident to a given vertex. Then a set of edges <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is a perfect matching if and only if <span class="math inline">\(\forall v \in V, \magn{M \cap \delta(v)} = 1\)</span>.<br />
For our IP, we can have a binary variable <span class="math inline">\(x_{\text{machine}, \text{task}}\)</span> for every edge <span class="math inline">\(\tup{\text{machine}, \text{task}}\)</span>. Now we can simply minimize <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{m_i \in m, t_j \in t} c_{m_i, t_j} x_{m_i, t_j}\)</span>.<br />
To constrain solutions to perfect matchings only, we can add the constraints <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{m_i \in m} \sum_{t_j \in \delta(m_i)} x_{m_i, t_j} = 1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{t_j \in t} \sum_{m_i \in \delta(t_j)} x_{m_i, t_j} = 1\)</span> (for each vertex, choose exactly one incident edge).</p>

<h1 id="section-4">17/1/17</h1>
<p>The <strong>shortest path</strong> problem: given a graph <span class="math inline">\(G = \tup{V, E}\)</span>, what is the <span class="math inline">\(s, t\)</span>-path that has the minimum total length? We want to formulate this as an IP.</p>
<p>Recall from MATH239 that a <strong>cut</strong> in a graph is a partitioning of <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> into two disjoint subsets, often written as just one of the sets. In other words, a cut is a pair <span class="math inline">\(\tup{S, T}\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(S \subseteq V, T \subseteq V, S \cap T = \emptyset, S \cup T = V\)</span>.</p>
<p>An <span class="math inline">\(s, t\)</span>-cut is a set of edges rather than a pair of sets of vertices. Let <span class="math inline">\(\delta(S) = \set{\set{u, v} \in E : u \in S, v \notin S}\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(S \subseteq V\)</span>. Then given <span class="math inline">\(s \in S\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t \notin S\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\delta(S)\)</span> is an <span class="math inline">\(s, t\)</span>-cut. To enumerate all <span class="math inline">\(s, t\)</span>-cuts, we can simply find all subsets of <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> that contain <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> but not <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, then apply <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> to those sets of vertices.</p>
<p>Clearly, if we remove the edges contained in the <span class="math inline">\(s, t\)</span>-cut from the graph, <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> would no longer be connected. Therefore, every <span class="math inline">\(s, t\)</span>-path must contain at least one edge from every <span class="math inline">\(s, t\)</span>-cut.</p>
<p>Also, if <span class="math inline">\(S \subseteq E\)</span> contains at least one edge from every <span class="math inline">\(s, t\)</span>-cut, then <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> also is a superset of an <span class="math inline">\(s, t\)</span>-path. This is because if <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> had an edge from every <span class="math inline">\(s, t\)</span>-cut and didn't have an <span class="math inline">\(s, t\)</span>-path, the set of all vertices <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> that can be reached from <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is an <span class="math inline">\(s, t\)</span>-cut (since it includes <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> but not <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, as no <span class="math inline">\(s, t\)</span>-path exists by assumption), so <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> must include an edge from <span class="math inline">\(\delta(R)\)</span>. However, <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> can't contain any edges from <span class="math inline">\(\delta(R)\)</span>, because if it did contain an edge <span class="math inline">\(\set{u, v}\)</span> then both <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> should have been in <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> (since they're reachable from <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>). Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> must also contain an <span class="math inline">\(s, t\)</span>-path.</p>
<p>Define binary variables <span class="math inline">\(x_1, \ldots, x_m\)</span> for each edge <span class="math inline">\(e_1, \ldots, e_m\)</span> being or not being in the shortest path, respectively. Let <span class="math inline">\(w_1, \ldots, w_n\)</span> be the weights of each edge <span class="math inline">\(e_1, \ldots, e_m\)</span>, respectively.</p>
<p>Clearly, we want to minimize <span class="math inline">\(x_1 w_1 + \ldots + x_m w_m\)</span> (i.e., the length of the path). What are the feasible solutions (i.e., supersets of <span class="math inline">\(s, t\)</span>-paths)?</p>
<p>To be an <span class="math inline">\(s, t\)</span>-path, the edges of the path must include at least one edge from every <span class="math inline">\(s, t\)</span>-cut. This is a lot easier to write as constraints: we have one constraint for each <span class="math inline">\(s, t\)</span>-cut <span class="math inline">\(\delta(S)\)</span>, and each constraint ensures that at least one of the edge variables <span class="math inline">\(T \subseteq \set{x_1, \ldots, x_m}\)</span> corresponding to <span class="math inline">\(\delta(S)\)</span> is true.</p>
<p>For example, given the graph <span class="math inline">\(G = \tup{\set{a, b, s, t}, \set{ab, as, at, bs, bt}}\)</span> with weights <span class="math inline">\(w_1, \ldots, w_5\)</span>, we might write the shortest path problem as &quot;minimize <span class="math inline">\(x_1 w_1 + \ldots + x_5 w_5\)</span> subject to <span class="math inline">\(x_2 + x_4 \ge 1\)</span> (for the <span class="math inline">\(s, t\)</span>-cut <span class="math inline">\(\set{sa, sb}\)</span>), <span class="math inline">\(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 \ge 1\)</span> (for the <span class="math inline">\(s, t\)</span>-cut <span class="math inline">\(\set{ab, as, at}\)</span>), <span class="math inline">\(x_1 + x_2 + x_5 \ge 1\)</span> (for the <span class="math inline">\(s, t\)</span>-cut <span class="math inline">\(\set{ab, as, bt}\)</span>), <span class="math inline">\(x_3 + x_5\)</span> (for the <span class="math inline">\(s, t\)</span>-cut <span class="math inline">\(\set{at, bt}\)</span>), and <span class="math inline">\(x_1, \ldots, x_m\)</span> are non-negative integers&quot;.</p>
<p>Note that we don't need an upper bound on <span class="math inline">\(x_1, \ldots, x_m\)</span>. This is because if it was greater than zero, then it wouldn't be an optimal solution.</p>
<p><strong>Nonlinear programs</strong> are problems of the form &quot;minimize <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> subject to <span class="math inline">\(g_1(x) \le 0, \ldots, g_m(x) \le 0\)</span>&quot; where <span class="math inline">\(f, g_1, \ldots, g_m: \mb{R}^n \to \mb{R}\)</span>. This is a superset of linear programs and integer programs. Basically, we can do arbitrary constraints, math permitting.</p>
<p>For example, we can minimize Euclidean distance by using an objective function <span class="math inline">\((x_1 - p_1)^2 + (x_2 - p_2)^2 + (x_3 - p_3)^2\)</span>. Another example is constraining variables to integers: simply add the constraint <span class="math inline">\(\sin(\pi x) = 0\)</span> to ensure that <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is an integer, or <span class="math inline">\(x(1 - x) = 0\)</span> to ensure that <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is either 0 or 1.</p>
<p>It's even possible to write Fermat's last theorem as a single NLP: &quot;minimize <span class="math inline">\((a^n + b^n - c^n)^2\)</span> subject to <span class="math inline">\(\sin(\pi a) = 0, \sin(\pi b) = 0, \sin(\pi c) = 0, \sin(\pi n) = 0, a, b, c \ge 1, n \ge 3\)</span>&quot; - the objective function solution is 0 if and only if <span class="math inline">\(a^n + b^n = c^n\)</span>, and the theorem is true if and only if the optimal value is greater than 0.</p>
