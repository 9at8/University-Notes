<p>Introduction to optimization.</p>
<pre><code>Levent Tunçel
Section 081 (online)
Email: ltuncel@uwaterloo.ca</code></pre>
<h1 id="section">3/1/17</h1>
<p>In this course, we will be studying linear programming, integer programming, the Simplex algorithm, and the concept of duality, as well as various ways to efficiently approximate answers to these sorts of problems.</p>
<p>An <strong>abstract optimization problem</strong> (also known as a &quot;P&quot;) is a problem in which we are trying to maximize or minimize a certain objective function - finding the inputs to the function, subject to certain constraints, such that the value of the function is maximised. In other words, given <span class="math inline">\(A \subseteq \mb{R}^n\)</span> (the set of all <strong>feasible inputs</strong>) and a function <span class="math inline">\(f: A \to \mb{R}\)</span> (the <strong>objective function</strong>), find <span class="math inline">\(x \in A\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> is the global maximum/minimum.</p>
<p>Optimization problems show up in almost every industry - hardware companies might want to simplify their circuit layouts, hotels might want to fill the most rooms possible at the highest price, and a factory might want to generate the most profit given constraints on materials and labour. Also, you can use it to play Pandemic optimally.</p>
<p>There are three types of abstract optimization problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linear programming problems (also known as LPs) are abstract optimization problems where <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is representable as a set of linear equations/inequalities, and <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a linear function.</li>
<li>Integer programming problems (also known as IPs) are linear programming problems where <span class="math inline">\(A \subseteq \mb{Z}^n\)</span>.</li>
<li>Non-linear programming problems (also known as NLPs) are abstract optimization problems where <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> cannot be represented as a set of linear equations/inequalities, or <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is non-linear.</li>
</ul>
<p>Abstract optimization problems are usually given as prose descriptions of the problems, which we then turn into abstract mathematical models/programs/problems. Then, we can take advantage of the many powerful computer solvers available today to automatically find optimal solutions.</p>
<p>Suppose a company produces either plastic carrots (which sell for $5 each and take 4 minutes to make) or rubber potatoes (which sell for $8 each and take 8 minutes to make). The company has 500 minutes available in the rest of the day, and the machine that makes either of these products can only be used up to 100 times - how many of each product should be made to maximize profit?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, we define our decision variables - the actual values we are trying to find. Let <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> be the number of carrots, and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> be the number of potatoes.<br />
Profit can now be defined as a function of those decision variables: <span class="math inline">\(f(c, p) = 5c + 8p\)</span>.<br />
Next, we can define constraints to specify <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. There are only 500 minutes left, and the time spent depends on the number of each product made, so <span class="math inline">\(4c + 8p \le 500\)</span>. There are only 100 products left that we can make, and this is simply the number of carrots and potatoes, so <span class="math inline">\(c + p \le 100\)</span>. Additionally, <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> must be non-negative, since they represent the number of each product.<br />
We now have a mathematical model of the problem: &quot;maximize <span class="math inline">\(5c + 3p\)</span> subject to <span class="math inline">\(4c + 3p \le 500\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c + p \le 100\)</span>&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <strong>feasible solution</strong> to an abstract optimization problem is any <span class="math inline">\(x \in A\)</span> - any variable assignment such that the constraints of the problem are satisfied, like <span class="math inline">\(c = 50, p = 10\)</span>. An <strong>optimal</strong> solution is one that actually solves the problem - a feasible solution that results in the global maximum/minimum of the objective function. Likewise, feasible solutions to prose descriptions of the problem are assignments to the unknowns, like &quot;make 50 carrots and 10 potatoes&quot;.</p>
<p>To show that a mathematical model of a problem is correct (properly represents the prose description of the problem), we usually define a bijection between feasible solutions for the mathematical model and feasible solutions for the prose description of the problem, such that the bijection <strong>preserves cost</strong> - each <span class="math inline">\(x \in A\)</span> for the mathematical model must have <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> equal to the the profit in the prose description for its corresponding feasible solution.</p>
<p>For example, show that the model from the above example is correct:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="math inline">\(4c + 3p \le 500 \land c + p \le 100\)</span> can be trivially bijected to &quot;carrots take 4 minutes to make and potatoes take 8 minutes, and the machine can only be used to make 100 products&quot;.<br />
Clearly, <span class="math inline">\(f(c, p) = 5c + 8p\)</span> has the same value as the profit since &quot;carrots sell for $5 each and potatoes sell for $8 each&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="section-1">5/1/17</h1>
<p>In this course we will mostly focus on affine optimization problems, since solving general optimization problems is much harder.</p>
<p>An <strong>affine function</strong> is one that can be written as <span class="math inline">\(f(\vec{x}) = \vec{a} \cdot \vec{x} + \beta\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\vec{a} \in \mb{R}^n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta \in \mb{R}\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(\beta = 0\)</span>, the function is also <strong>linear</strong>.</p>
<p>A <strong>linear program</strong> is an abstract optimization problem of the form <span class="math inline">\(\min \set{f(x) : x \in \mb{R}^n \wedge \left(\forall 1 \le i \le m, g_i(x) \le b_i\right)}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is affine, <span class="math inline">\(g_1, \ldots, g_m\)</span> are all linear, and <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is finite. We might also replace <span class="math inline">\(\min\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\max\)</span> depending on the problem.</p>
<p>Usually we write this as: &quot;minimize <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> subject to <span class="math inline">\(g_1 \le b_1, \ldots, g_m \le b_m\)</span>&quot;, or &quot;maximize <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> s.t. <span class="math inline">\(g_1 \le b_1, \ldots, g_m \le b_m\)</span>&quot;. It's also common to use <span class="math inline">\(\vec{x} \le \mb{0}\)</span> as shorthand for <span class="math inline">\(x_1 \ge 0, \ldots, x_n \ge 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Suppose an oil company in the next 4 months needs to supply 5000L, 8000L, 9000L, and 6000L, respectively, and oil costs them 0.75/L, 0.72/L, 0.92/L, and 0.90/L, respectively. The company has an oil tank that can store up to 4000L, and starts off with 2000L. Oil is bought at the beginning of the month, is used throughout the month, and is all dumped into the tank at the end of the month. What quantity of oil should be bought in each month to minimize cost?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clearly, the inputs are the quantity of oil bought in each month, <span class="math inline">\(b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4\)</span>. For convenience, we will also define the tank value at the beginning of each month, <span class="math inline">\(t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4\)</span>. Clearly, <span class="math inline">\(0 \le t_1 \le 4000, 0 \le t_2 \le 4000, 0 \le t_3 \le 4000, 0 \le t_4 \le 4000\)</span>, since the capacity of the tank is 4000L.<br />
The objective function we are minimizing is <span class="math inline">\(f(b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4) = 0.75b_1 + 0.72b_2 + 0.92b_3 + 0.90b_4\)</span>.<br />
Clearly, the tank level in month <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(t_1 = 2000, t_2 = t_1 + b_1 - 5000, t_3 = t_2 + b_2 - 8000, t_4 = t_3 + b_3 - 9000\)</span>, since the tank level is just the leftover oil after supplying the last month's oil.<br />
Clearly, in order to supply enough oil, we must have <span class="math inline">\(t_1 + b_1 \ge 5000, t_2 + b_2 \ge 8000, t_3 + b_3 \ge 9000, t_4 + b_4 \ge 6000\)</span>. However, the first three constraints are redundant with the previously defined constraints <span class="math inline">\(t_2 = t_1 + b_1 - 5000, t_3 = t_2 + b_2 - 8000, t_4 = t_3 + b_3 - 9000\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(0 \le t_1, 0 \le t_2, 0 \le t_3, 0 \le t_4\)</span>, so we only need the <span class="math inline">\(t_4 + b_4 \ge 6000\)</span> constraint.<br />
These encode all of the problem constraints, so we have &quot;minimize <span class="math inline">\(0.75b_1 + 0.72b_2 + 0.92b_3 + 0.90b_4\)</span> subject to <span class="math inline">\(0 \le t_1 \le 4000, 0 \le t_2 \le 4000, 0 \le t_3 \le 4000, 0 \le t_4 \le 4000\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t_1 = 2000, t_2 = t_1 + b_1 - 5000, t_3 = t_2 + b_2 - 8000, t_4 = t_3 + b_3 - 9000\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t_4 \ge 6000\)</span>&quot;.<br />
If we use a linear programming solver, we get <span class="math inline">\(b_1 = 3000, b_2 = 12000, b_3 = 5000, b_4 = 6000\)</span>, which gives us the minimum cost 20890.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Same thing, but minimise the maximum amount of oil purchased in any single month, and then show that the model is correct assuming that the above example's model was correct:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the previous example, we have the same constraints <span class="math inline">\(0 \le t_1 \le 4000, 0 \le t_2 \le 4000, 0 \le t_3 \le 4000, 0 \le t_4 \le 4000\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t_1 = 2000, t_2 = t_1 + b_1 - 5000, t_3 = t_2 + b_2 - 8000, t_4 = t_3 + b_3 - 9000\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t_4 \ge 6000\)</span>.<br />
However, the objective function is different - let <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> be the maximum amount of oil bought in a single month, and we can minimize this value. We can define <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> to be the maximum amount of oil bought in a single month by adding the constraints <span class="math inline">\(b_1 \le M, b_2 \le M, b_3 \le M, b_4 \le M\)</span>.<br />
These encode all of the problem constraints, so we have &quot;minimize <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> subject to <span class="math inline">\(0 \le t_1 \le 4000, 0 \le t_2 \le 4000, 0 \le t_3 \le 4000, 0 \le t_4 \le 4000\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t_1 = 2000, t_2 = t_1 + b_1 - 5000, t_3 = t_2 + b_2 - 8000, t_4 = t_3 + b_3 - 9000\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t_4 \ge 6000\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_1 \le M, b_2 \le M, b_3 \le M, b_4 \le M\)</span>&quot;.<br />
Now to show correctness. Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is an optimal solution that has values <span class="math inline">\(b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is a feasible solution, <span class="math inline">\(M \ge \max\set{b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4}\)</span>, and since <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is an optimal solution, it is the lowest such value that satisfies that, so <span class="math inline">\(M = \max\set{b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4}\)</span>. Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is also the minimum maximum amount of oil purchased in any single month.</p>
